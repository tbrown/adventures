<p>In all his short life Whitefoot the Wood Mouse never had spent such a happy winter. Whitefoot is one of those wise little people who never allow unpleasant things of the past to spoil their present happiness, and who never borrow trouble from the future. Whitefoot believes in getting the most from the present. The things which are past are past, and that is all there is to it. There is no use in thinking about them. As for the things of the future, it will be time enough to think about them when they happen.</p>

<p>If you and I had as many things to worry about as does Whitefoot the Wood Mouse, we probably never would be happy at all. But Whitefoot is happy whenever he has a chance to be, and in this he is wiser than most human beings. You see, there is not one of all the little people in the Green Forest who has so many enemies to watch out for as has Whitefoot. There are ever so many who would like nothing better than to dine on plump little Whitefoot. There are Becky Bear and Billy Mink and Shadow the Weasel and Uncle Billy Possum and Hooty the Owl and all the members of the Hawk family, not to mention Blacky the Crow in times when other food is scarce. Reddy and Granny Fox and Old Man Coyote are always looking for him.</p>

<p>So you see Whitefoot never knows at what instant he may have to run for his life. That is why he is such a timid little fellow and is always running away at the least little unexpected sound. In spite of all this he is a happy little chap.</p>

<p>It was early in the winter that Whitefoot found a little hole in a corner of Farmer Brown&rsquo;s sugar — house and crept inside to see what it was like in there. It didn&rsquo;t take him long to decide that it was the most delightful place he ever had found. He promptly decided to move in and spend the winter. In one end of the sugar-house was a pile of wood. Down under this Whitefoot made himself a warm, comfortable nest. It was a regular castle to Whitefoot. He moved over to it the store of seeds he had laid up for winter use.</p>

<p>Not one of his enemies ever thought of visiting the sugar-house in search of Whitefoot, and they wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to get in if they had. When rough Brother North Wind howled outside, and sleet and snow were making other little people shiver, Whitefoot was warm and comfortable. There was all the room he needed or wanted in which to run about and play. He could go outside when he chose to, but he didn&rsquo;t choose to very often. For days at a time he didn&rsquo;t have a single fright. Yes indeed, Whitefoot spent a happy winter.</p>

<h2 id="ch2"><a href="#ch2"><span>II</span> Whitefoot Sees Queer Things</a></h2>

<p>Whitefoot had spent the winter undisturbed in Farmer Brown&rsquo;s sugar-house. He had almost forgotten the meaning of fear. He had come to look on that sugar-house as belonging to him. It wasn&rsquo;t until Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl came over to prepare things for sugaring that Whitefoot got a single real fright. The instant Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl opened the door, Whitefoot scampered down under the pile of wood to his snug little nest, and there he lay, listening to the strange sounds. At last he could stand it no longer and crept to a place where he could peep out and see what was going on. It didn&rsquo;t take him long to discover that this great two-legged creature was not looking for him, and right away he felt better. After a while Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl went away, and Whitefoot had the little sugar-house to himself again.</p>

<p>But Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl had carelessly left the door wide open. Whitefoot didn&rsquo;t like that open door. It made him nervous. There was nothing to prevent those who hunt him from walking right in. So the rest of that night Whitefoot felt uncomfortable and anxious.</p>

<p>He felt still more anxious when next day Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl returned and became very busy putting things to right. Then Farmer Brown himself came and strange things began to happen. It became as warm as in summer. You see Farmer Brown had built a fire under the evaporator. Whitefoot&rsquo;s curiosity kept him at a place where he could peep out and watch all that was done. He saw Farmer Brown and Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl pour pails of sap into a great pan. By and by a delicious odor filled the sugar-house. It didn&rsquo;t take him a great while to discover that these two-legged creatures were so busy that he had nothing to fear from them, and so he crept out to watch. He saw them draw the golden syrup from one end of the evaporator and fill shining tin cans with it. Day after day they did the same thing. At night when they had left and all was quiet inside the sugar-house, Whitefoot stole out and found delicious crumbs where they had eaten their lunch. He tasted that thick golden stuff and found it sweet and good. Later he watched them make sugar and nearly made himself sick that night when they had gone home, for they had left some of that sugar where he could get at it. He didn&rsquo;t understand these queer doings at all. But he was no longer afraid.</p>

<h2 id="ch3"><a href="#ch3"><span>III</span> Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl Becomes Acquainted</a></h2>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t take Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl long to discover that Whitefoot the Wood Mouse was living in the little sugar-house. She caught glimpses of Whitefoot peeping out at her. Now Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl is wise in the ways of the little people of the Green Forest. Right away she made up her mind to get acquainted with Whitefoot. She knew that not in all the Green Forest is there a more timid little fellow than Whitefoot, and she thought it would be a fine thing to be able to win the confidence of such a shy little chap.</p>

<p>So at first Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl paid no attention whatever to Whitefoot. She took care that Whitefoot shouldn&rsquo;t even know that he had been seen. Every day when she ate her lunch, Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl scattered a lot of crumbs close to the pile of wood under which Whitefoot had made his home. Then she and Farmer Brown would go out to collect sap. When they returned not a crumb would be left.</p>

<p>One day Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl scattered some particularly delicious crumbs. Then, instead of going out, she sat down on a bench and kept perfectly still. Farmer Brown and Bella the Hound went out. Of course Whitefoot heard them go out, and right away he poked his little head out from under the pile of wood to see if the way was clear. Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl sat there right in plain sight, but Whitefoot didn&rsquo;t see her. That was because Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl didn&rsquo;t move the least bit. Whitefoot ran out and at once began to eat those delicious crumbs. When he had filled his little stomach, he began to carry the remainder back to his storehouse underneath the woodpile. While he was gone on one of these trips, Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl scattered more crumbs in a line that led right up to her foot. Right there she placed a big piece of bread crust.</p>

<p>Whitefoot was working so hard and so fast to get all those delicious bits of food that he took no notice of anything else until he reached that piece of crust. Then he happened to look up right into the eyes of Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl. With a frightened little squeak Whitefoot darted back, and for a long time he was afraid to come out again.</p>

<p>But Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl didn&rsquo;t move, and at last Whitefoot could stand the temptation no longer. He darted out halfway, scurried back, came out again, and at last ventured right up to the crust. Then he began to drag it back to the woodpile. Still Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl did not move.</p>

<p>For two or three days the same thing happened. By this time, Whitefoot had lost all fear. He knew that Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl would not harm him, and it was not long before he ventured to take a bit of food from Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl&rsquo;s hand. After that Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl took care that no crumbs should be scattered on the ground. Whitefoot had to come to her for his food, and always Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl had something delicious for him.</p>

<h2 id="ch4"><a href="#ch4"><span>IV</span> Whitefoot Grows Anxious</a></h2>

<p>   &lsquo;Tis sad indeed to trust a friend    Then have that trust abruptly end.       &ndash;Whitefoot</p>

<p>I know of nothing that is more sad than to feel that a friend is no longer to be trusted. There came a time when Whitefoot the Wood Mouse almost had this feeling. It was a very, very anxious time for Whitefoot.</p>

<p>You see, Whitefoot and Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl had become the very best of friends there in the little sugar-house. They had become such good friends that Whitefoot did not hesitate to take food from the hands of Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl. Never in all his life had he had so much to eat or such good things to eat. He was getting so fat that his handsome little coat was uncomfortably tight. He ran about fearlessly while Farmer Brown and Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl were making maple syrup and maple sugar. He had even lost his fear of Bella the Hound, for Bella had paid no attention to him whatever.</p>

<p>Now you remember that Whitefoot had made his home way down beneath the great pile of wood in the sugar-house. Of course Farmer Brown and Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl used that wood for the fire to boil the sap to make the syrup and sugar. Whitefoot thought nothing of this until one day he discovered that his little home was no longer as dark as it had been. A little ray of light crept down between the sticks. Presently another little ray of light crept down between the sticks.</p>

<p>It was then that Whitefoot began to grow anxious. It was then he realized that that pile of wood was growing smaller and smaller, and if it kept on growing smaller, by and by there wouldn&rsquo;t be any pile of wood and his little home wouldn&rsquo;t be hidden at all. Of course Whitefoot didn&rsquo;t understand why that wood was slipping away. In spite of himself he began to grow suspicious. He couldn&rsquo;t think of any reason why that wood should be taken away, unless it was to look for his little home. Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl was just as kind and friendly as ever, but all the time more and more light crept in, as the wood vanished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, what does it mean?&rdquo; cried Whitefoot to himself. &ldquo;They must be looking for my home, yet they have been so good to me that it is hard to believe they mean any harm. I do hope they will stop taking this wood away. I won&rsquo;t have any hiding-place at all, and then I will have to go outside back to my old home in the hollow stump. I don&rsquo;t want to do that. Oh, dear! Oh, dear! I was so happy and now I am so worried! Why can&rsquo;t happy times last always?&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="ch5"><a href="#ch5"><span>V</span> The End Of Whitefoot&rsquo;s Worries</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p class="q">
    “Work, work all the night<br>
    While the stars are shining bright;<br>
    Work, work all the day;<br>
    I have got no time to play.”
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>   You never can tell!  You never can tell!    Things going wrong will often end well.       &ndash;Whitefoot.</p>

<p>The next time you meet him just ask Whitefoot if this isn&rsquo;t so. Things had been going very wrong for Whitefoot. It had begun to look to Whitefoot as if he would no longer have a snug, hidden little home in Farmer Brown&rsquo;s sugar-house. The pile of wood under which he had made that snug little home was disappearing so fast that it began to look as if in a little while there would be no wood at all.</p>

<p>Whitefoot quite lost his appetite. He no longer came out to take food from Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl&rsquo;s hand. He stayed right in his snug little home and worried.</p>

<p>Now Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl had not once thought of the trouble she was making. She wondered what had become of Whitefoot, and in her turn she began to worry. She was afraid that something had happened to her little friend. She was thinking of this as she fed the sticks of wood to the fire for boiling the sap to make syrup and sugar. Finally, as she pulled away two big sticks, she saw something that made her whistle with surprise. It was Whitefoot&rsquo;s nest which he had so cleverly hidden way down underneath that pile of wood when he had first moved into the sugar-house. With a frightened little squeak, Whitefoot ran out, scurried across the little sugar-house and out though the open door.</p>

<p>Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl understood. She understood perfectly that little people like Whitefoot want their homes hidden away in the dark. &ldquo;Poor little chap,&rdquo; said Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl. &ldquo;He had a regular castle here and we have destroyed it. He&rsquo;s got the snuggest kind of a little nest here, but he won&rsquo;t come back to it so long as it is right out in plain sight. He probably thinks we have been hunting for this little home of his. Hello! Here&rsquo;s his storehouse! I&rsquo;ve often wondered how the little rascal could eat so much, but now I understand. He stored away here more than half of the good things I have given him. I am glad he did. If he hadn&rsquo;t, he might not come back, but I feel sure that tonight, when all is quiet, he will come back to take away all his food. I must do something to keep him here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl sat down to think things over. Then she got an old box and made a little round hole in one end of it. Very carefully she took up Whitefoot&rsquo;s nest and placed it under the old box in the darkest corner of the sugar-house. Then she carried all Whitefoot&rsquo;s supplies over there and put them under the box. She went outside, and got some branches of hemlock and threw these in a little pile over the box. After this she scattered some crumbs just outside.</p>

<p>Late that night Whitefoot did come back. The crumbs led him to the old box. He crept inside. There was his snug little home! All in a second Whitefoot understood, and trust and happiness returned.</p>

<h2 id="ch6"><a href="#ch6"><span>VI</span> A Very Careless Jump</a></h2>

<p>Whitefoot once more was happy. When he found his snug little nest and his store of food under that old box in the darkest corner of Farmer Brown&rsquo;s sugar-house, he knew that Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl must have placed them there. It was better than the old place under the woodpile. It was the best place for a home Whitefoot ever had had. It didn&rsquo;t take him long to change his mind about leaving the little sugar-house. Somehow he seemed to know right down inside that his home would not again be disturbed.</p>

<p>So he proceeded to rearrange his nest and to put all his supplies of food in one corner of the old box. When everything was placed to suit him he ventured out, for now that he no longer feared Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl he wanted to see all that was going on. He liked to jump up on the bench where Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl sometimes sat. He would climb up to where Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl&rsquo;s coat hung and explore the pockets of it. Once he stole Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl&rsquo;s handkerchief. He wanted it to add to the material his nest was made of. Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl discovered it just as it was disappearing, and how she laughed as she pulled it away.</p>

<p>So, what with eating and sleeping and playing about, secure in the feeling that no harm could come to him, Whitefoot was happier than ever before in his little life. He knew that Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl and Farmer Brown and Bella the Hound were his friends. He knew, too, that so long as they were about, none of his enemies would dare come near. This being so, of course there was nothing to be afraid of. No harm could possibly come to him. At least, that is what Whitefoot thought.</p>

<p>But you know, enemies are not the only dangers to watch out for. Accidents will happen. When they do happen, it is very likely to be when the possibility of them is farthest from your thoughts. Almost always they are due to heedlessness or carelessness. It was heedlessness that got Whitefoot into one of the worst mishaps of his whole life.</p>

<p>He had been running and jumping all around the inside of the little sugar-house. He loves to run and jump, and he had been having just the best time ever. Finally Whitefoot ran along the old bench and jumped from the end of it for a box standing on end, which Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl sometimes used to sit on. It wasn&rsquo;t a very long jump, but somehow Whitefoot misjudged it. He was heedless, and he didn&rsquo;t jump quite far enough. Right beside that box was a tin pail half filled with sap. Instead of landing on the box, Whitefoot landed with a splash in that pail of sap.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="ch6"><a href="#ch6"><span>VI</span> A Very Careless Jump</a></h2>

<p>CHAPTER VII: Whitefoot Gives Up Hope</p>

<p>Whitefoot had been in many tight places. Yes, indeed, Whitefoot had been in many tight places. He had had narrow escapes of all kinds. But never had he felt so utterly hopeless as now. The moment he landed in that sap, Whitefoot began to swim frantically. He isn&rsquo;t a particularly good swimmer, but he could swim well enough to keep afloat for a while. His first thought was to scramble up the side of the tin pail, but when he reached it and tried to fasten his sharp little claws into it in order to climb, he discovered that he couldn&rsquo;t. Sharp as they were, his little claws just slipped, and his struggles to get up only resulted in tiring him out and in plunging him wholly beneath the sap. He came up choking and gasping. Then round and round inside that pail he paddled, stopping every two or three seconds to try to climb up that hateful, smooth, shiny wall.</p>

<p>The more he tried to climb out, the more frightened he became.</p>

<p>He was in a perfect panic of fear. He quite lost his head, did Whitefoot. The harder he struggled, the more tired he became, and the greater was his danger of drowning.</p>

<p>Whitefoot squeaked pitifully. He didn&rsquo;t want to drown. Of course not. He wanted to live. But unless he could get out of that pail very soon, he would drown. He knew it. He knew that he couldn&rsquo;t hold on much longer. He knew that just as soon as he stopped paddling, he would sink. Already he was so tired from his frantic efforts to escape that it seemed to him that he couldn&rsquo;t hold out any longer. But somehow he kept his legs moving, and so kept afloat.</p>

<p>Just why he kept struggling, Whitefoot couldn&rsquo;t have told. It wasn&rsquo;t because he had any hope. He didn&rsquo;t have the least bit of hope. He knew now that he couldn&rsquo;t climb the sides of that pail, and there was no other way of getting out. Still he kept on paddling. It was the only way to keep from drowning, and though he felt sure that he had got to drown at last, he just wouldn&rsquo;t until he actually had to. And all the time Whitefoot squeaked hopelessly, despairingly, pitifully. He did it without knowing that he did it, just as he kept paddling round and round.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="ch6"><a href="#ch6"><span>VI</span> A Very Careless Jump</a></h2>

<p>CHAPTER VIII: The Rescue</p>

<p>When Whitefoot made the heedless jump that landed him in a pail half filled with sap, no one else was in the little sugar-house. Whitefoot was quite alone. You see, Farmer Brown and Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl were out collecting sap from the trees, and Bella the Hound was with them.</p>

<p>Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl was the first to return. She came in just after Whitefoot had given up all hope. She went at once to the fire to put more wood on. As she finished this job she heard the faintest of little squeaks. It was a very pitiful little squeak. Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl stood perfectly still and listened. She heard it again. She knew right away that it was the voice of Whitefoot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; exclaimed Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl. &ldquo;That sounds as if Whitefoot is in trouble of some kind. I wonder where the little rascal is. I wonder what can have happened to him. I must look into this.&rdquo; Again Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl heard that faint little squeak. It was so faint that she couldn&rsquo;t tell where it came from. Hurriedly and anxiously she looked all over the little sugar-house, stopping every few seconds to listen for that pitiful little squeak. It seemed to come from nowhere in particular. Also it was growing fainter.</p>

<p>At last Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl happened to stand still close to that tin pail half filled with sap. She heard the faint little squeak again and with it a little splash. It was the sound of the little splash that led her to look down. In a flash she understood what had happened. She saw poor little Whitefoot struggling feebly, and even as she looked Whitefoot&rsquo;s head went under. He was very nearly drowned.</p>

<p>Stooping quickly, Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl grabbed Whitefoot&rsquo;s long tail and pulled him out. Whitefoot was so nearly drowned that he didn&rsquo;t have strength enough to even kick. A great pity filled the eyes of Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl as she held Whitefoot&rsquo;s head down and gently shook him. She was trying to shake some of the sap out of Whitefoot. It ran out of Whitefoot&rsquo;s nose and out of his mouth. Whitefoot began to gasp. Then Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl spread her coat close by the fire, rolled Whitefoot up in her handkerchief and gently placed him on the coat. For some time Whitefoot lay just gasping. But presently his breath came easier, and after a while he was breathing naturally. But he was too weak and tired to move, so he just lay there while Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl gently stroked his head and told him how sorry she was.</p>

<p>Little by little Whitefoot recovered his strength. At last he could sit up, and finally he began to move about a little, although he was still wobbly on his legs. Farmer Brown&rsquo;s girl put some bits of food where Whitefoot could get them, and as he ate, Whitefoot&rsquo;s beautiful soft eyes were filled with gratitude.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IX: Two Timid Persons Meet</p>

<p>   Thus always you will meet life&rsquo;s test&ndash;    To do the thing you can do best.       &ndash;Whitefoot.</p>

<p>Jumper the Hare sat crouched at the foot of a tree in the Green Forest. Had you happened along there, you would not have seen him. At least, I doubt if you would. If you had seen him, you probably wouldn&rsquo;t have known it. You see, in his white coat Jumper was so exactly the color of the snow that he looked like nothing more than a little heap of snow.</p>

<p>Just in front of Jumper was a little round hole. He gave it no attention. It didn&rsquo;t interest him in the least. All through the Green Forest were little holes in the snow. Jumper was so used to them that he seldom noticed them. So he took no notice of this one until something moved down in that hole. Jumper&rsquo;s eyes opened a little wider and he watched. A sharp little face with very bright eyes filled that little round hole. Jumper moved just the tiniest bit, and in a flash that sharp little face with the bright eyes disappeared. Jumper sat still and waited. After a long wait the sharp little face with bright eyes appeared again. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened, Whitefoot,&rdquo; said Jumper softly. At the first word the sharp little face disappeared, but in a moment it was back, and the sharp little eyes were fixed on Jumper suspiciously. After a long stare the suspicion left them, and out of the little round hole came trim little Whitefoot in a soft brown coat with white waistcoat and with white feet and a long, slim tail. This winter he was not living in Farmer Brown&rsquo;s sugarhouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gracious, Jumper, how you did scare me!&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>Jumper chuckled. &ldquo;Whitefoot, I believe you are more timid than I am,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I be? I&rsquo;m ever so much smaller, and I have more enemies,&rdquo; retorted Whitefoot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true you are smaller, but I am not so sure that you have more enemies,&rdquo; replied Jumper thoughtfully. &ldquo;It sometimes seems to me that I couldn&rsquo;t have more, especially in winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Name them,&rdquo; commanded Whitefoot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hooty the Great Horned Owl, Yowler the Bob Cat, Old Man Coyote, Reddy Fox, Terror the Goshawk, Shadow the Weasel, Billy Mink.&rdquo; Jumper paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; demanded Whitefoot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that enough?&rdquo; retorted Jumper rather sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have all of those and Blacky the Crow and Butcher the Shrike and Sammy Jay in winter, and Becky Bear and Jimmy Skunk and several of the Snake family in summer,&rdquo; replied Whitefoot. &ldquo;It seems to me sometimes as if I need eyes and ears all over me. Night and day there is always some one hunting for poor little me. And then some folks wonder why I am so timid. If I were not as timid as I am, I wouldn&rsquo;t be alive now; I would have been caught long ago. Folks may laugh at me for being so easily frightened, but I don&rsquo;t care. That is what saves my life a dozen times a day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jumper looked interested. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a very timid person myself, and sometimes I have been ashamed of being so easily frightened. But come to think of it, I guess you are right; the more timid I am, the longer I am likely to live.&rdquo; Whitefoot suddenly darted into his hole. Jumper didn&rsquo;t move, but his eyes widened with fear. A great white bird had just alighted on a stump a short distance away. It was Whitey the Snowy Owl, down from the Far North.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is another enemy we both forgot,&rdquo; thought Jumper, and tried not to shiver.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="ch6"><a href="#ch6"><span>VI</span> A Very Careless Jump</a></h2>

<p>CHAPTER X: The White Watchers</p>

<p>   Much may be gained by sitting still    If you but have the strength of will.     &ndash;Whitefoot.</p>

<p>Jumper the Hare crouched at the foot of a tree in the Green Forest, and a little way from him on a stump sat Whitey the Snowy Owl. Had you been there to see them, both would have appeared as white as the snow around them unless you had looked very closely. Then you might have seen two narrow black lines back of Jumper&rsquo;s head. They were the tips of his ears, for these remain black. And near the upper part of the white mound which was Whitey you might have seen two round yellow spots, his eyes.</p>

<p>There they were for all the world like two little heaps of snow. Jumper didn&rsquo;t move so much as a hair. Whitey didn&rsquo;t move so much as a feather. Both were waiting and watching. Jumper didn&rsquo;t move because he knew that Whitey was there. Whitey didn&rsquo;t move because he didn&rsquo;t want any one to know he was there, and didn&rsquo;t know that Jumper was there. Jumper was sitting still because he was afraid. Whitey was sitting still because he was hungry.</p>

<p>So there they sat, each in plain sight of the other but only one seeing the other. This was because Jumper had been fortunate enough to see Whitey alight on that stump. Jumper had been sitting still when Whitey arrived, and so those fierce yellow eyes had not yet seen him. But had Jumper so much as lifted one of those long ears, Whitey would have seen, and his great claws would have been reaching for Jumper.</p>

<p>Jumper didn&rsquo;t want to sit still. No, indeed! He wanted to run. You know it is on those long legs of his that Jumper depends almost wholly for safety. But there are times for running and times for sitting still, and this was a time for sitting still. He knew that Whitey didn&rsquo;t know that he was anywhere near. But just the same it was hard, very hard to sit there with one he so greatly feared watching so near. It seemed as if those fierce yellow eyes of Whitey must see him. They seemed to look right through him. They made him shake inside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to run. I want to run. I want to run,&rdquo; Jumper kept saying to himself. Then he would say, &ldquo;But I mustn&rsquo;t. I mustn&rsquo;t. I mustn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; And so Jumper did the hardest thing in the world — sat still and stared danger in the face. He was sitting still to save his life.</p>

<p>Whitey the Snowy Owl was sitting still to catch a dinner. I know that sounds queer, but it was so. He knew that so long as he sat still, he was not likely to be seen. It was for this purpose that Old Mother Nature had given him that coat of white. In the Far North, which was his real home, everything is white for months and months, and anyone dressed in a dark suit can be seen a long distance. So Whitey had been given that white coat that he might have a better chance to catch food enough to keep him alive.</p>

<p>And he had learned how to make the best use of it. Yes, indeed, he knew how to make the best use of it. It was by doing just what he was doing now — sitting perfectly still. Just before he had alighted on that stump he had seen something move at the entrance to a little round hole in the snow. He was sure of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Mouse,&rdquo; thought Whitey, and alighted on that stump. &ldquo;He saw me flying, but he&rsquo;ll forget about it after a while and will come out again. He won&rsquo;t see me then if I don&rsquo;t move. And I won&rsquo;t move until he is far enough from that hole for me to catch him before he can get back to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the two watchers in white sat without moving for the longest time, one watching for a dinner and the other watching the other watcher.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XI: Jumper Is In Doubt</p>

<p>   When doubtful what course to pursue    'Tis sometimes best to nothing do.      &ndash;Whitefoot.</p>

<p>Jumper the Hare was beginning to feel easier in his mind. He was no longer shaking inside. In fact, he was beginning to feel quite safe. There he was in plain sight of Whitey the Snowy Owl, sitting motionless on a stump only a short distance away, yet Whitey hadn&rsquo;t seen him. Whitey had looked straight at him many times, but because Jumper had not moved so much as a hair Whitey had mistaken him for a little heap of snow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All I have to do is to keep right on sitting perfectly still, and I&rsquo;ll be as safe as if Whitey were nowhere about. Yes, sir, I will,&rdquo; thought Jumper. &ldquo;By and by he will become tired and fly away. I do hope he&rsquo;ll do that before Whitefoot comes out again. If Whitefoot should come out, I couldn&rsquo;t warn him because that would draw Whitey&rsquo;s attention to me, and he wouldn&rsquo;t look twice at a Wood Mouse when there was a chance to get a Hare for his dinner.</p>

<p>&quot;This is a queer world. It is so. Old Mother Nature does queer things. Here she has given me a white coat in winter so that I may not be easily seen when there is snow on the ground, and at the same time she has given one of those I fear most a white coat so that he may not be easily seen, either. It certainly is a queer world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jumper forgot that Whitey was only a chance visitor from the Far North and that it was only once in a great while that he came down there, while up in the Far North where he belonged nearly everybody was dressed in white.</p>

<p>Jumper hadn&rsquo;t moved once, but once in a while Whitey turned his great round head for a look all about in every direction. But it was done in such a way that only eyes watching him sharply would have noticed it. Most of the time he kept his fierce yellow eyes fixed on the little hole in the snow in which Whitefoot had disappeared. You know Whitey can see by day quite as well as any other bird.</p>

<p>Jumper, having stopped worrying about himself, began to worry about Whitefoot. He knew that Whitefoot had seen Whitey arrive on that stump and that was why he had dodged back into his hole and since then had not even poked his nose out. But that had been so long ago that by this time Whitefoot must think that Whitey had gone on about his business, and Jumper expected to see Whitefoot appear any moment. What Jumper didn&rsquo;t know was that Whitefoot&rsquo;s bright little eyes had all the time been watching Whitey from another little hole in the snow some distance away. A tunnel led from this little hole to the first little hole.</p>

<p>Suddenly off among the trees something moved. At least, Jumper thought he saw something move. Yes, there it was, a little black spot moving swiftly this way and that way over the snow. Jumper stared very hard. And then his heart seemed to jump right up in his throat. It did so. He felt as if he would choke. That black spot was the tip end of a tail, the tail of a small, very slim fellow dressed all in white, the only other one in all the Green Forest who dresses all in white. It was Shadow the Weasel! In his white winter coat he is called Ermine.</p>

<p>He was running this way and that way, back and forth, with his nose to the snow. He was hunting, and Jumper knew that sooner or later Shadow would find him. Safety from Shadow lay in making the best possible use of those long legs of his, but to do that would bring Whitey the Owl swooping after him. What to do Jumper didn&rsquo;t know. And so he did nothing. It happened to be the wisest thing he could do.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="ch6"><a href="#ch6"><span>VI</span> A Very Careless Jump</a></h2>

<p>CHAPTER XII: Whitey The Owl Saves Jumper</p>

<p>   It often happens in the end    An enemy may prove a friend.       &ndash;Whitefoot.</p>

<p>Was ever any one in a worse position than Jumper the Hare? To move would be to give himself away to Whitey the Snowy Owl. If he remained where he was very likely Shadow the Weasel would find him, and the result would be the same as if he were caught by Whitey the Owl. Neither Whitey nor Shadow knew he was there, but it would be only a few minutes before one of them knew it. At least, that is the way it looked to Jumper.</p>

<p>Whitey wouldn&rsquo;t know it unless he moved, but Shadow the Weasel would find his tracks, and his nose would lead him straight there. Back and forth, back and forth, this way, that way and the other way, just a little distance off, Shadow was running with his nose to the snow. He was hunting — hunting for the scent of some one whom he could kill. In a few minutes he would be sure to find where Jumper had been, and then his nose would lead him straight to that tree at the foot of which Jumper was crouching.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came Shadow. He was slim and trim and didn&rsquo;t look at all terrible. Yet there was no one in all the Green Forest more feared by the little people in fur, by Jumper, by Peter Rabbit, by Whitefoot, even by Chatterer the Red Squirrel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; thought Jumper, &ldquo;he won&rsquo;t find my scent after all. Perhaps he&rsquo;ll go in another direction.&rdquo; But all the time Jumper felt in his bones that Shadow would find that scent. &ldquo;When he does, I&rsquo;ll run,&rdquo; said Jumper to himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have at least a chance to dodge Whitey. I am afraid he will catch me, but I&rsquo;ll have a chance. I won&rsquo;t have any chance at all if Shadow finds me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly Shadow stopped running and sat up to look about with fierce little eyes, all the time testing the air with his nose. Jumper&rsquo;s heart sank. He knew that Shadow had caught a faint scent of some one. Then Shadow began to run back and forth once more, but more carefully than before. And then he started straight for where Jumper was crouching! Jumper knew then that Shadow had found his trail.</p>

<p>Jumper drew a long breath and settled his long hind feet for a great jump, hoping to so take Whitey the Owl by surprise that he might be able to get away. And as Jumper did this, he looked over to that stump where Whitey had been sitting so long. Whitey was just leaving it on his great silent wings, and his fierce yellow eyes were fixed in the direction of Shadow the Weasel. He had seen that moving black spot which was the tip of Shadow&rsquo;s tail.</p>

<p>Jumper didn&rsquo;t have time to jump before Whitey was swooping down at Shadow. So Jumper just kept still and watched with eyes almost popping from his head with fear and excitement.</p>

<p>Shadow hadn&rsquo;t seen Whitey until just as Whitey was reaching for him with his great cruel claws. Now if there is any one who can move more quickly than Shadow the Weasel I don&rsquo;t know who it is. Whitey&rsquo;s claws closed on nothing but snow; Shadow had dodged. Then began a game, Whitey swooping and Shadow dodging, and all the time they were getting farther and farther from where Jumper was.</p>

<p>The instant it was safe to do so, Jumper took to his long heels and the way he disappeared, lipperty-lipperty-lip, was worth seeing. Whitey the Snowy Owl had saved him from Shadow the Weasel and didn&rsquo;t know it. An enemy had proved to be a friend.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="ch6"><a href="#ch6"><span>VI</span> A Very Careless Jump</a></h2>

<p>CHAPTER XIII: Whitefoot Decides Quickly</p>

<p>   Your mind made up a certain way    Be swift to act; do not delay.       &ndash;Whitefoot.</p>

<p>When Whitefoot had discovered Whitey the Snowy Owl, he had dodged down in the little hole in the snow beside which he had been sitting. He had not been badly frightened. But he was somewhat upset. Yes, sir, he was somewhat upset. You see, he had so many enemies to watch out for, and here was another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as if I didn&rsquo;t have troubles enough without having this white robber to add to them,&rdquo; grumbled Whitefoot. &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t he stay where he belongs, way up in the Far North? It must be that food is scarce up there. Well, now that I know he is here, he will have to be smarter than I think he is to catch me. I hope Jumper the Hare will have sense enough to keep perfectly still. I&rsquo;ve sometimes envied him his long legs, but I guess I am better off than he is, at that. Once he has been seen by an enemy, only those long legs of his can save him, but I have a hundred hiding-places down under the snow. Whitey is watching the hole where I disappeared; he thinks I&rsquo;ll come out there again after a while. I&rsquo;ll fool him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whitefoot scampered along through a little tunnel and presently very cautiously peeped out of another little round hole in the snow. Sure enough, there was Whitey the Snowy Owl back to him on a stump, watching the hole down which he had disappeared a few minutes before. Whitefoot grinned. Then he looked over to where he had last seen Jumper. Jumper was still there; it was clear that he hadn&rsquo;t moved, and so Whitey hadn&rsquo;t seen him. Again Whitefoot grinned. Then he settled himself to watch patiently for Whitey to become tired of watching that hole and fly away.</p>

<p>So it was that Whitefoot saw all that happened. He saw Whitey suddenly sail out on silent wings from that stump and swoop with great claws reaching for someone. And then he saw who that some one was — Shadow the Weasel! He saw Shadow dodge in the very nick of time. Then he watched Whitey swoop again and again as Shadow dodged this way and that way. Finally both disappeared amongst the trees. Then he turned just in time to see Jumper the Hare bounding away with all the speed of his wonderful, long legs.</p>

<p>Fear, the greatest fear he had known for a long time, took possession of Whitefoot. &ldquo;Shadow the Weasel!&rdquo; he gasped and had such a thing been possible he certainly would have turned pale. &ldquo;Whitey won&rsquo;t catch him; Shadow is too quick for him. And when Whitey has given up and flown away, Shadow will come back. He probably had found the tracks of Jumper the Hare and he will come back. I know him; he&rsquo;ll come back. Jumper is safe enough from him now, because he has such a long start, but Shadow will be sure to find one of my holes in the snow. Oh, dear! Oh, dear! What shall I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>You see Shadow the Weasel is the one enemy that can follow Whitefoot into most of his hiding-places.</p>

<p>For a minute or two Whitefoot sat there, shaking with fright. Then he made up his mind. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get away from here before he returns,&rdquo; thought Whitefoot. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to. I&rsquo;ve spent a comfortable winter here so far, but there will be no safety for me here any longer. I don&rsquo;t know where to go, but anywhere will be better than here now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without waiting another second, Whitefoot scampered away. And how he did hope that his scent would have disappeared by the time Shadow returned. If it hadn&rsquo;t, there would be little hope for him and he knew it.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="ch6"><a href="#ch6"><span>VI</span> A Very Careless Jump</a></h2>

<p>CHAPTER XIV: Shadow&rsquo;s Return</p>

<p>   He little gains and has no pride    Who from his purpose turns aside.      &ndash;Whitefoot.</p>

<p>Shadow the Weasel believes in persistence. When he sets out to do a thing, he keeps at it until it is done or he knows for a certainty it cannot be done. He is not easily discouraged. This is one reason he is so feared by the little people he delights to hunt. They know that once he gets on their trail, they will be fortunate indeed if they escape him.</p>

<p>When Whitey the Snowy Owl swooped at him and so nearly caught him, he was not afraid as he dodged this way and that way. Any other of the little people with the exception of his cousin, Billy Mink, would have been frightened half to death. But Shadow was simply angry. He was angry that any one should try to catch him. He was still more angry because his hunt for Jumper the Hare was interfered with. You see, he had just found Jumper&rsquo;s trail when Whitey swooped at him.</p>

<p>So Shadow&rsquo;s little eyes grew red with rage as he dodged this way and that and was gradually driven away from the place where he had found the trail of Jumper the Hare. At last he saw a hole in an old log and into this he darted. Whitey couldn&rsquo;t get him there. Whitey knew this and he knew, too, that waiting for Shadow to come out again would be a waste of time. So Whitey promptly flew away.</p>

<p>Hardly had he disappeared when Shadow popped out of that hole, for he had been peeping out and watching Whitey. Without a moment&rsquo;s pause he turned straight back for the place where he had found the trail of Jumper the Hare. He had no intention of giving up that hunt just because he had been driven away. Straight to the very spot where Whitey had first swooped at him he ran, and there once more his keen little nose took up the trail of Jumper. It led him straight to the foot of the tree where Jumper had crouched so long.</p>

<p>But, as you know, Jumper wasn&rsquo;t there then. Shadow ran in a circle and presently he found where Jumper had landed on the snow at the end of that first bound. Shadow snarled. He understood exactly what had happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jumper was under that tree when that white robber from the Far North tried to catch me, and he took that chance to leave in a hurry. I can tell that by the length of this jump. Probably he is still going. It is useless to follow him because he has too long a start,&rdquo; said Shadow, and he snarled again in rage and disappointment.</p>

<p>Then, for such is his way, he wasted no more time or thought on Jumper the Hare. Instead he began to look for other trails. So it was that he found one of the little holes of Whitefoot the Wood Mouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! So this is where Whitefoot has been living this winter!&rdquo; he exclaimed. Once more his eyes glowed red, but this time with eagerness and the joy of the hunt. He plunged down into that little hole in the snow. Down there the scent of Whitefoot was strong. Shadow followed it until it led out of another little hole in the snow. But there he lost it. You see, it was so long since Whitefoot had hurriedly left that the scent on the surface had disappeared.</p>

<p>Shadow ran swiftly this way and that way in a big circle, but he couldn&rsquo;t find Whitefoot&rsquo;s trail again. Snarling with anger and disappointment, he returned to the little hole in the snow and vanished. Then he followed all Whitefoot&rsquo;s little tunnels. He found Whitefoot&rsquo;s nest. He found his store of seeds. But he didn&rsquo;t find Whitefoot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll come back,&rdquo; muttered Shadow, and curled up in Whitefoot&rsquo;s nest to wait.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="ch6"><a href="#ch6"><span>VI</span> A Very Careless Jump</a></h2>

<p>CHAPTER XV: Whitefoot&rsquo;s Dreadful Journey</p>

<p>   Danger may be anywhere,    So I expect it everywhere.       &ndash;Whitefoot.</p>

<p>Whitefoot the Wood Mouse was terribly frightened. Yes, sir, he was terribly frightened. It was a long, long time since he had been as frightened as he now was. He is used to frights, is Whitefoot. He has them every day and every night, but usually they are sudden frights, quickly over and as quickly forgotten.</p>

<p>This fright was different. You see Whitefoot had caught a glimpse of Shadow the Weasel. And he knew that if Shadow returned he would be sure to find the little round holes in the snow that led down to Whitefoot&rsquo;s private little tunnels underneath.</p>

<p>The only thing for Whitefoot to do was to get just as far from that place as he could before Shadow should return. And so poor little Whitefoot started out on a journey that was to take him he knew not where. All he could do was to go and go and go until he could find a safe hiding-place.</p>

<p>My, my, but that was a dreadful journey! Every time a twig snapped, Whitefoot&rsquo;s heart seemed to jump right up in his throat. Every time he saw a moving shadow, and the branches of the trees moving in the wind were constantly making moving shadows on the snow, he dodged behind a tree trunk or under a piece of bark or wherever he could find a hiding-place.</p>

<p>You see, Whitefoot has so many enemies always looking for him that he hides whenever he sees anything moving. When at home, he is forever dodging in and out of his hiding-places. So, because everything was strange to him, and because of the great fear of Shadow the Weasel, he suspected everything that moved and every sound he heard. For a long way no one saw him, for no one was about. Yet all that way Whitefoot twisted and dodged and darted from place to place and was just as badly frightened as if there had been enemies all about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! Oh, dear me!&rdquo; he kept saying over and over to himself. &ldquo;Wherever shall I go? Whatever shall I do? However shall I get enough to eat? I won&rsquo;t dare go back to get food from my little storehouses, and I shall have to live in a strange place where I won&rsquo;t know where to look for food. I am getting tired. My legs ache. I&rsquo;m getting hungry. I want my nice, warm, soft bed. Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But in spite of his frights, Whitefoot kept on. You see, he was more afraid to stop than he was to go on. He just had to get as far from Shadow the Weasel as he could. Being such a little fellow, what would be a short distance for you or me is a long distance for Whitefoot.</p>

<p>And so that journey was to him very long indeed. Of course, it seemed longer because of the constant frights which came one right after another. It really was a terrible journey. Yet if he had only known it, there wasn&rsquo;t a thing along the whole way to be afraid of. You know it often happens that people are frightened more by what they don&rsquo;t know than by what they do know.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="ch6"><a href="#ch6"><span>VI</span> A Very Careless Jump</a></h2>

<p>CHAPTER XVI: Whitefoot Climbs A Tree</p>

<p>    I&rsquo;d rather be frightened With no cause for fear     Than fearful of nothing When danger is near.       &ndash;Whitefoot.</p>

<p>Whitefoot kept on going and going. Every time he thought that he was so tired he must stop, he would think of Shadow the Weasel and then go on again. By and by he became so tired that not even the thought of Shadow the Weasel could make him go much farther. So he began to look about for a safe hiding-place in which to rest.</p>

<p>Now the home which he had left had been a snug little room beneath the roots of a certain old stump. There he had lived for a long time in the greatest comfort. Little tunnels led to his storehouses and up to the surface of the snow. It had been a splendid place and one in which he had felt perfectly safe until Shadow the Weasel had appeared. Had you seen him playing about there, you would have thought him one of the little people of the ground, like his cousin Danny Meadow Mouse.</p>

<p>But Whitefoot is quite as much at home in trees as on the ground. In fact, he is quite as much at home in trees as is Chatterer the Red Squirrel, and a lot more at home in trees than is Striped Chipmunk, although Striped Chipmunk belongs to the Squirrel family. So now that he must find a hiding-place, Whitefoot decided that he would feel much safer in a tree than on the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If only I can find a hollow tree,&rdquo; whimpered Whitefoot. &ldquo;I will feel ever so much safer in a tree than hiding in or near the ground in a strange place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Whitefoot began to look for a dead tree. You see, he knew that there was more likely to be a hollow in a dead tree than in a living tree. By and by he came to a tall, dead tree. He knew it was a dead tree, because there was no bark on it. But, of course, he couldn&rsquo;t tell whether or not that tree was hollow. I mean he couldn&rsquo;t tell from the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; he whimpered again. &ldquo;Oh, dear! I suppose I will have to climb this, and I am so tired. It ought to be hollow. There ought to be splendid holes in it. It is just the kind of a tree that Drummer the Woodpecker likes to make his house in. I shall be terribly disappointed if I don&rsquo;t find one of his houses somewhere in it, but I wish I hadn&rsquo;t got to climb it to find out. Well, here goes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked anxiously this way. He looked anxiously that way. He looked anxiously the other way. In fact, he looked anxiously every way.</p>

<p>But he saw no one and nothing to be afraid of, and so he started up the tree.</p>

<p>He was half-way up when, glancing down, he saw a shadow moving across the snow. Once more Whitefoot&rsquo;s heart seemed to jump right up in his throat. That shadow was the shadow of some one flying. There couldn&rsquo;t be the least bit of doubt about it. Whitefoot flattened himself against the side of the tree and peeked around it. He was just in time to see a gray and black and white bird almost the size of Sammy Jay alight in the very next tree. He had come along near the ground and then risen sharply into the tree. His bill was black, and there was just a tiny hook on the end of it. Whitefoot knew who it was. It was Butcher the Shrike. Whitefoot shivered.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="ch6"><a href="#ch6"><span>VI</span> A Very Careless Jump</a></h2>

<p>CHAPTER XVII: Whitefoot Finds A Hole Just In Time</p>

<p>   Just in time, not just too late,    Will make you master of your fate.      &ndash;Whitefoot.</p>

<p>Whitefoot, half-way up that dead tree, flattened himself against the trunk and, with his heart going pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat with fright, peered around the tree at an enemy he had not seen for so long that he had quite forgotten there was such a one. It was Butcher the Shrike. Often he is called just Butcher Bird. He did not look at all terrible. He was not quite as big as Sammy Jay. He had no terrible claws like the Hawks and Owls. There was a tiny hook at the end of his black bill, but it wasn&rsquo;t big enough to look very dreadful. But you can not always judge a person by looks, and Whitefoot knew that Butcher was one to be feared.</p>

<p>So his heart went pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat as he wondered if Butcher had seen him. He didn&rsquo;t have to wait long to find out. Butcher flew to a tree back of Whitefoot and then straight at him. Whitefoot dodged around to the other side of the tree. Then began a dreadful game. At least, it was dreadful to Whitefoot. This way and that way around the trunk of that tree he dodged, while Butcher did his best to catch him.</p>

<p>Whitefoot would not have minded this so much, had he not been so tired, and had he known of a hiding-place close at hand. But he was tired, very tired, for you remember he had had what was a very long and terrible journey to him. He had felt almost too tired to climb that tree in the first place to see if it had any holes in it higher up. Now he didn&rsquo;t know whether to keep on going up or to go down. Two or three times he dodged around the tree without doing either. Then he decided to go up.</p>

<p>Now Butcher was enjoying this game of dodge. If he should catch Whitefoot, he would have a good dinner. If he didn&rsquo;t catch Whitefoot, he would simply go hungry a little longer. So you see, there was a very big difference in the feelings of Whitefoot and Butcher. Whitefoot had his life to lose, while Butcher had only a dinner to lose.</p>

<p>Dodging this way and dodging that way, Whitefoot climbed higher and higher. Twice he whisked around that tree trunk barely in time. All the time he was growing more and more tired, and more and more discouraged. Supposing he should find no hole in that tree!</p>

<p>&ldquo;There must be one. There must be one,&rdquo; he kept saying over and over to himself, to keep his courage up. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t keep dodging much longer. If I don&rsquo;t find a hole pretty soon, Butcher will surely catch me. Oh, dear! Oh, dear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just above Whitefoot was a broken branch. Only the stub of it remained. The next time he dodged around the trunk he found himself just below that stub. Oh, joy! There, close under that stub, was a round hole. Whitefoot didn&rsquo;t hesitate a second. He didn&rsquo;t wait to find out whether or not any one was in that hole. He didn&rsquo;t even think that there might be some one in there. With a tiny little squeak of relief he darted in. He was just in time. He was just in the nick of time. Butcher struck at him and just missed him as he disappeared in that hole. Whitefoot had saved his life and Butcher had missed a dinner.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="ch6"><a href="#ch6"><span>VI</span> A Very Careless Jump</a></h2>

<p>CHAPTER XVIII: An Unpleasant Surprise</p>

<p>   Be careful never to be rude    Enough to thoughtlessly intrude.      &ndash;Whitefoot.</p>

<p>If ever anybody in the Great World felt relief and thankfulness, it was Whitefoot when he dodged into that hole in the dead tree just as Butcher the Shrike all but caught him. For a few minutes he did nothing but pant, for he was quite out of breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was right,&rdquo; he said over and over to himself, &ldquo;I was right. I was sure there must be a hole in this tree. It is one of the old houses of Drummer the Woodpecker. Now I am safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Presently he peeped out. He wanted to see if Butcher was watching outside. He was just in time to see Butcher&rsquo;s gray and black and white coat disappearing among the trees. Butcher was not foolish enough to waste time watching for Whitefoot to come out. Whitefoot sighed happily. For the first time since he had started on his dreadful journey he felt safe. Nothing else mattered. He was hungry, but he didn&rsquo;t mind that. He was willing to go hungry for the sake of being safe.</p>

<p>Whitefoot watched until Butcher was out of sight. Then he turned to see what that house was like. Right away he discovered that there was a soft, warm bed in it. It was made of leaves, grass, moss, and the lining of bark. It was a very fine bed indeed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My, my, my, but I am lucky,&rdquo; said Whitefoot to himself. &ldquo;I wonder who could have made this fine bed. I certainly shall sleep comfortably here. Goodness knows, I need a rest. If I can find food enough near here, I&rsquo;ll make this my home. I couldn&rsquo;t ask for a better one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chuckling happily, Whitefoot began to pull away the top of that bed so as to get to the middle of it. And then he got a surprise. It was an unpleasant surprise. It was a most unpleasant surprise. There was someone in that bed! Yes, sir, there was someone curled up in a little round ball in the middle of that fine bed. It was someone with a coat of the softest, finest fur. Can you guess who it was? It was Katie the Flying Squirrel.</p>

<p>It seemed to Whitefoot as if his heart flopped right over. You see at first he didn&rsquo;t recognize Katie. Whitefoot is himself so very timid that his thought was to run; to get out of there as quickly as possible. But he had no place to run to, so he hesitated. Never in all his life had Whitefoot had a greater disappointment. He knew now that this splendid house was not for him.</p>

<p>Katie the Flying Squirrel didn&rsquo;t move. She remained curled up in a soft little ball. She was asleep. Whitefoot remembered that Katie sleeps during the day and seldom comes out until the Black Shadows come creeping out from the Purple Hills at the close of day. Whitefoot felt easier in his mind then. Katie was so sound asleep that she knew nothing of her visitor. And so Whitefoot felt safe in staying long enough to get rested. Then he would go out and hunt for another home.</p>

<p>So down in the middle of that soft, warm bed Katie the Flying Squirrel, curled up in a little round ball with her flat tail wrapped around her, slept peacefully, and on top of that soft bed Whitefoot the Wood Mouse rested and wondered what he should do next. Not in all the Green Forest could two more timid little people be found than the two in that old home of Drummer the Woodpecker.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="ch6"><a href="#ch6"><span>VI</span> A Very Careless Jump</a></h2>

<p>CHAPTER XIX: Whitefoot Finds A Home At Last</p>

<p>   True independence he has known    Whose home has been his very own.      &ndash;Whitefoot.</p>

<p>Curled up in her splendid warm bed, Katie the Flying Squirrel slept peacefully. She didn&rsquo;t know she had a visitor. She didn&rsquo;t know that on top of that same bed lay Whitefoot the Wood Mouse. Whitefoot wasn&rsquo;t asleep. No, indeed! Whitefoot was too worried to sleep. He knew he couldn&rsquo;t stay in that fine house because it belonged to Katie. He knew that as soon as Katie awoke, he, Whitefoot, would have to get out. Where should he go? He wished he knew. How he did long for the old home he had left. But when he thought of that, he remembered Shadow the Weasel. It was better to be homeless than to feel that at any minute Shadow the Weasel might appear.</p>

<p>It was getting late in the afternoon. Before long, jolly, round, red Mr. Sun would go to bed behind the Purple Hills, and the Black Shadows would come creeping through the Green Forest. Then Katie the Flying Squirrel would awake. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do for me to be here then,&rdquo; said Whitefoot to himself. &ldquo;I must find some other place before she wakes. If only I knew this part of the Green Forest I might know where to go. As it is, I shall have to go hunt for a new home and trust to luck. Did ever a poor little Mouse have so much trouble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>After awhile Whitefoot felt rested and peeped out of the doorway. No enemy was to be seen anywhere. Whitefoot crept out and climbed a little higher up in the tree. Presently he found another hole. He peeped inside and listened long and carefully. He didn&rsquo;t intend to make the mistake of going into another house where some one might be living.</p>

<p>At last, sure that there was no one in there, he crept in. Then he made a discovery. There were beech nuts in there and there were seeds.</p>

<p>It was a storehouse! Whitefoot knew at once that it must be Katie&rsquo;s storehouse. Right away he realized how very, very hungry he was. Of course, he had no right to any of those seeds or nuts. Certainly not! That is, he wouldn&rsquo;t have had any right had he been a boy or girl. But it is the law of the Green Forest that whatever any one finds he may help himself to if he can.</p>

<p>So Whitefoot began to fill his empty little stomach with some of those seeds. He ate and ate and ate and quite forgot all his troubles. Just as he felt that he hadn&rsquo;t room for another seed, he heard the sound of claws outside on the trunk of the tree. In a flash he knew that Katie the Flying Squirrel was awake, and that it wouldn&rsquo;t do to be found in there by her. In a jiffy Whitefoot was outside. He was just in time. Katie was almost up to the entrance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi, there!&rdquo; cried Katie. &ldquo;What were you doing in my storehouse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;I&ndash;I was looking for a new home,&rdquo; stammered Whitefoot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean you were stealing some of my food,&rdquo; snapped Katie suspiciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;I&ndash;I did take a few seeds because I was almost starved. But truly I was looking for a new home,&rdquo; replied Whitefoot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the matter with your old home?&rdquo; demanded Katie.</p>

<p>Then Whitefoot told Katie all about how he had been obliged to leave his old home because of Shadow the Weasel, of the terrible journey he had had, and how he didn&rsquo;t know where to go or what to do. Katie listened suspiciously at first, but soon she made up her mind that Whitefoot was telling the truth. The mere mention of Shadow the Weasel made her very sober.</p>

<p>She scratched her nose thoughtfully. &ldquo;Over in that tall, dead stub you can see from here is an old home of mine,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;No one lives in it now. I guess you can live there until you can find a better home. But remember to keep away from my storehouse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So it was that Whitefoot found a new home.</p>

<p></p>

<p>CHAPTER XX: Whitefoot Makes Himself At Home</p>

<p>   Look not too much on that behind    Lest to the future you be blind.      &ndash;Whitefoot.</p>

<p>Whitefoot didn&rsquo;t wait to be told twice of that empty house. He thanked Katie and then scampered over to that stub as fast as his legs would take him. Up the stub he climbed, and near the top he found a little round hole. Katie had said no one was living there now, and so Whitefoot didn&rsquo;t hesitate to pop inside.</p>

<p>There was even a bed in there. It was an old bed, but it was dry and soft. It was quite clear that no one had been in there for a long time. With a little sigh of pure happiness, Whitefoot curled up in that bed for the sleep he so much needed. His stomach was full, and once more he felt safe. The very fact that this was an old house in which no one had lived for a long time made it safer. Whitefoot knew that those who lived in that part of the Green Forest probably knew that no one lived in that old stub, and so no one was likely to visit it.</p>

<p>He was so tired that he slept all night. Whitefoot is one of those who sleeps when he feels sleepy, whether it be by day or night. He prefers the night to be out and about in, because he feels safer then, but he often comes out by day. So when he awoke in the early morning, he promptly went out for a look about and to get acquainted with his new surroundings.</p>

<p>Just a little way off was the tall, dead tree in which Katie the Flying Squirrel had her home. Katie was nowhere to be seen. You see, she had been out most of the night and had gone to bed to sleep through the day. Whitefoot thought longingly of the good things in Katie&rsquo;s storehouse in that same tree, but decided that it would be wisest to keep away from there. So he scurried about to see what he could find for a breakfast. It didn&rsquo;t take him long to find some pine cones in which a few seeds were still clinging. These would do nicely. Whitefoot ate what he wanted and then carried some of them back to his new home in the tall stub.</p>

<p>Then he went to work to tear to pieces the old bed in there and make it over to suit himself. It was an old bed of Katie the Flying Squirrel, for you know this was Katie&rsquo;s old house.</p>

<p>Whitefoot soon had the bed made over to suit him. And when this was done he felt quite at home. Then he started out to explore all about within a short distance of the old stub. He wanted to know every hole and every possible hiding-place all around, for it is on such knowledge that his life depends.</p>

<p>When at last he returned home he was very well satisfied. &ldquo;It is going to be a good place to live,&rdquo; said he to himself. &ldquo;There are plenty of hiding-places and I am going to be able to find enough to eat. It will be very nice to have Katie the Flying Squirrel for a neighbor. I am sure she and I will get along together very nicely. I don&rsquo;t believe Shadow the Weasel, even if he should come around here, would bother to climb up this old stub. He probably would expect to find me living down in the ground or close to it, anyway. I certainly am glad that I am such a good climber. Now if Becky Bear doesn&rsquo;t come along in the spring and pull this old stub over, I&rsquo;ll have as fine a home as any one could ask for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, because happily it is the way with the little people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows, Whitefoot forgot all about his terrible journey and the dreadful time he had had in finding his new home.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="ch6"><a href="#ch6"><span>VI</span> A Very Careless Jump</a></h2>

<p>CHAPTER XXI: Whitefoot Envies Katie</p>

<p>   A useless thing is envy;       A foolish thing to boot.    Why should a Fox who has a bark       Want like an Owl to hoot?</p>

<p>Whitefoot was beginning to feel quite at home. He would have been wholly contented but for one thing — he had no well-filled storehouse. This meant that each day he must hunt for his food.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t that Whitefoot minded hunting for food. He would have done that anyway, even though he had had close at hand a store-house with plenty in it. But he would have felt easier in his mind. He would have had the comfortable feeling that if the weather turned so bad that he could not easily get out and about, he would not have to go hungry.</p>

<p>But Whitefoot is a happy little fellow and wisely made the best of things. At first he came out very little by day. He knew that there were many sharp eyes watching for him, and that he was more likely to be seen in the light of day than when the Black Shadows had crept all through the Green Forest.</p>

<p>He would peek out of his doorway and watch for chance visitors in the daytime. Twice he saw Butcher the Shrike alight a short distance from the tree in which Katie lived. He knew Butcher had not forgotten that he had chased a badly frightened Mouse into a hole in that tree. Once he saw Whitey the Snowy Owl and so knew that Whitey had not yet returned to the Far North. Once Reddy Fox trotted along right past the foot of the old stub in which Whitefoot lived, and didn&rsquo;t even suspect that he was anywhere near. Twice he saw Old Man Coyote trotting past, and once Terror the Goshawk alighted on that very stub, and sat there for half an hour.</p>

<p>So Whitefoot formed the habit of doing just what Katie the Flying Squirrel did; he remained in his house for most of the day and came out when the Black Shadows began to creep in among the trees. Katie came out about the same time, and they had become the best of friends.</p>

<p>Now Whitefoot is not much given to envying others, but as night after night he watched Katie a little envy crept into his heart in spite of all he could do. Katie would nimbly climb to the top of a tree and then jump. Down she would come in a long beautiful glide, for all the world as if she were sliding on the air.</p>

<p>The first time Whitefoot saw her do it he held his breath. He really didn&rsquo;t know what to make of it. The nearest tree to the one from which Katie had jumped was so far away that it didn&rsquo;t seem possible any one without wings could reach it without first going to the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; squeaked Whitefoot. &ldquo;Oh! She&rsquo;ll kill herself! She surely will kill herself! She&rsquo;ll break her neck!&rdquo; But Katie did nothing of the kind. She sailed down, down, down and alighted on that distant tree a foot or two from the bottom; and without stopping a second scampered up to the top of that tree and once more jumped. Whitefoot had hard work to believe his own eyes. Katie seemed to be jumping just for the pleasure of it. As a matter of fact, she was. She was getting her evening exercise.</p>

<p>Whitefoot sighed. &ldquo;I wish I could jump like that,&rdquo; said he to himself. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t ever be afraid of anybody if I could jump like that. I envy Katie. I do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p></p>

<p>CHAPTER XXII: Katie Proves To Be A True Neighbor</p>

<p>   He proves himself a neighbor true    Who seeks a kindly deed to do.      &ndash;Whitefoot.</p>

<p>Occasionally Katie the Flying Squirrel came over to visit Whitefoot. If Whitefoot was in his house he always knew when Katie arrived. He would hear a soft thump down near the bottom of the tall stub. He would know instantly that thump was made by Katie striking the foot of the stub after a long jump from the top of a tree. Whitefoot would poke his head out of his doorway and there, sure enough, would be Katie scrambling up towards him.</p>

<p>Whitefoot had grown to admire Katie with all his might. It seemed to him that Katie was the most wonderful of all the people he knew. You see there was none of the others who could jump as Katie could. Katie on her part enjoyed having Whitefoot for a neighbor. Few of the little people of the Green Forest are more timid than Katie the Flying Squirrel, but here was one beside whom Katie actually felt bold. It was such a new feeling that Katie enjoyed it.</p>

<p>So it was that in the dusk of early evening, just after the Black Shadows had come creeping out from the Purple Hills across the Green Meadows and through the Green Forest, these two little neighbors would start out to hunt for food. Whitefoot never went far from the tall, dead stub in which he was now living. He didn&rsquo;t dare to. He wanted to be where at the first sign of danger he could scamper back there to safety. Katie would go some distance, but she was seldom gone long. She liked to be where she could watch and talk with Whitefoot. You see Katie is very much like other people — she likes to gossip a little.</p>

<p>One evening Whitefoot had found it hard work to find enough food to fill his stomach. He had kept going a little farther and a little farther from home. Finally he was farther from it than he had ever been before. Katie had filled her stomach and from near the top of a tree was watching Whitefoot. Suddenly what seemed like a great Black Shadow floated right over the tree in which Katie was sitting, and stopped on the top of a tall, dead tree. It was Hooty the Owl, and it was simply good fortune that Katie happened to see him. Katie did not move. She knew that she was safe so long as she kept perfectly still. She knew that Hooty didn&rsquo;t know she was there. Unless she moved, those great eyes of Hooty&rsquo;s, wonderful as they were, would not see her.</p>

<p>Katie looked over to where she had last seen Whitefoot. There he was picking out seeds from a pine cone on the ground. The trunk of a tree was between him and Hooty. But Katie knew that Whitefoot hadn&rsquo;t seen Hooty, and that any minute he might run out from behind that tree. If he did Hooty would see him, and silently as a shadow would swoop down and catch him. What was to be done?</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no business of mine,&rdquo; said Katie to herself. &ldquo;Whitefoot must look out for himself. It is no business of mine at all. Perhaps Hooty will fly away before Whitefoot moves. I don&rsquo;t want anything to happen to Whitefoot, but if something does, it will be his own fault; he should keep better watch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a few minutes nothing happened. Then Whitefoot finished the last seed in that cone and started to look for more. Katie knew that in a moment Hooty would see Whitefoot. What do you think Katie did? She jumped. Yes, sir, she jumped. Down, down, down, straight past the tree on which sat Hooty the Owl, Katie sailed. Hooty saw her. Of course. He couldn&rsquo;t help but see her. He spread his great wings and was after Katie in an instant. Katie struck near the foot of a tree and without wasting a second darted around to the other side. She was just in time. Hooty was already reaching for her. Up the tree ran Katie and jumped again. Again Hooty was too late. And so Katie led Hooty the Owl away from Whitefoot the Wood Mouse.</p>

<p></p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIII: Whitefoot Spends A Dreadful Night</p>

<p>   Pity those who suffer fright    In the dark and stilly night.      &ndash;Whitefoot.</p>

<p>One night of his life Whitefoot will never forget so long as he lives. Even now it makes him shiver just to think of it. Yes, sir, he shivers even now whenever he thinks of that night. The Black Shadows had come early that evening, so that it was quite dusk when Whitefoot crept out of his snug little bed and climbed up to the round hole which was the doorway of his home. He had just poked his nose out that little round doorway when there was the most terrible sound. It seemed to him as if it was in his very ears, so loud and terrible was it. It frightened him so that he simply let go and tumbled backward down inside his house. Of course it didn&rsquo;t hurt him any, for he landed on his soft bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whooo-hoo-hoo, whooo-hoo!&rdquo; came that terrible sound again, and Whitefoot shook until his little teeth rattled. At least, that is the way it seemed to him. It was the voice of Hooty the Owl, and Whitefoot knew that Hooty was sitting on the top of that very stub. He was, so to speak, on the roof of Whitefoot&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>Now in all the Green Forest there is no sound that strikes terror to the hearts of the little people of feathers and fur equal to the hunting call of Hooty the Owl. Hooty knows this. No one knows it better than he does. That is why he uses it. He knows that many of the little people are asleep, safely hidden away. He knows that it would be quite useless for him to simply look for them. He would starve before he could find a dinner in that way. But he knows that any one wakened from sleep in great fright is sure to move, and if they do this they are almost equally sure to make some little sound. His ears are so wonderful that they can catch the faintest sound and tell exactly where it comes from. So he uses that terrible hunting cry to frighten the little people and make them move.</p>

<p>Now Whitefoot knew that he was safe. Hooty couldn&rsquo;t possibly get at him, even should he find out that he was in there. There was nothing to fear, but just the same, Whitefoot shivered and shook and jumped almost out of his skin every time that Hooty hooted. He just couldn&rsquo;t help it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t get me. I know he can&rsquo;t get me. I&rsquo;m perfectly safe. I&rsquo;m just as safe as if he were miles away. There&rsquo;s nothing to be afraid of. It is silly to be afraid. Probably Hooty doesn&rsquo;t even know I am inside here. Even if he does, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.&rdquo; Whitefoot said these things to himself over and over again. Then Hooty would send out that fierce, terrible hunting call and Whitefoot would jump and shake just as before.</p>

<p>After a while all was still. Gradually Whitefoot stopped trembling. He guessed that Hooty had flown away. Still he remained right where he was for a very long time. He didn&rsquo;t intend to foolishly take any chances. So he waited and waited and waited.</p>

<p>At last he was sure that Hooty had left. Once more he climbed up to his little round doorway and there he waited some time before poking even his nose outside. Then, just as he had made up his mind to go out, that terrible sound rang out again, and just as before he tumbled heels over head down on his bed.</p>

<p>Whitefoot didn&rsquo;t go out that night at all. It was a moonlit night and just the kind of a night to be out. Instead Whitefoot lay in his little bed and shivered and shook, for all through that long night every once in a while Hooty the Owl would hoot from the top of that stub.</p>

<p></p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIV: Whitefoot The Wood Mouse Is Unhappy</p>

<p>   Unhappiness without a cause you never, never find;    It may be in the stomach, or it may be in the mind.      &ndash;Whitefoot.</p>

<p>Whitefoot the Wood Mouse should have been happy, but he wasn&rsquo;t. Winter had gone and sweet Mistress Spring had brought joy to all the Green Forest. Every one was happy, Whitefoot no less so than his neighbors at first. Up from the Sunny South came the feathered friends and at once began planning new homes. Twitterings and songs filled the air. Joy was everywhere. Food became plentiful, and Whitefoot became sleek and fat. That is, he became as fat as a lively Wood Mouse ever does become. None of his enemies had discovered his new home, and he had little to worry about.</p>

<p>But by and by Whitefoot began to feel less joyous. Day by day he grew more and more unhappy. He no longer took pleasure in his fine home. He began to wander about for no particular reason. He wandered much farther from home than he had ever been in the habit of doing. At times he would sit and listen, but what he was listening for he didn&rsquo;t know. &ldquo;There is something the matter with me, and I don&rsquo;t know what it is,&rdquo; said Whitefoot to himself forlornly. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be anything I have eaten. I have nothing to worry about. Yet there is something wrong with me. I&rsquo;m losing my appetite. Nothing tastes good any more. I want something, but I don&rsquo;t know what it is I want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tried to tell his troubles to his nearest neighbor, Katie the Flying Squirrel, but Katie was too busy to listen. When Peter Rabbit happened along, Whitefoot tried to tell him. But Peter himself was too happy and too eager to learn all the news in the Green Forest to listen. No one had any interest in Whitefoot&rsquo;s troubles. Every one was too busy with his own affairs.</p>

<p>So day by day Whitefoot the Wood Mouse grew more and more unhappy, and when the dusk of early evening came creeping through the Green Forest, he sat about and moped instead of running about and playing as he had been in the habit of doing. The beautiful song of Melody the Wood Thrush somehow filled him with sadness instead of with the joy he had always felt before. The very happiness of those about him seemed to make him more unhappy.</p>

<p>Once he almost decided to go hunt for another home, but somehow he couldn&rsquo;t get interested even in this. He did start out, but he had not gone far before he had forgotten all about what he had started for. Always he had loved to run about and climb and jump for the pure pleasure of it, but now he no longer did these things. He was unhappy, was Whitefoot. Yes, sir, he was unhappy; and for no cause at all so far as he could see.</p>

<p></p>

<p>CHAPTER XXV: Whitefoot Finds Out What The Matter Was</p>

<p>   Pity the lonely, for deep in the heart    Is an ache that no doctor can heal by his art.     &ndash;Whitefoot.</p>

<p>Of all the little people of the Green Forest Whitefoot seemed to be the only one who was unhappy. And because he didn&rsquo;t know why he felt so he became day by day more unhappy. Perhaps I should say that night by night he became more unhappy, for during the brightness of the day he slept most of the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is something wrong, something wrong,&rdquo; he would say over and over to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be with me, because everybody else is happy, and this is the happiest time of all the year. I wish some one would tell me what ails me. I want to be happy, but somehow I just can&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One evening he wandered a little farther from home than usual. He wasn&rsquo;t going anywhere in particular. He had nothing in particular to do. He was just wandering about because somehow he couldn&rsquo;t remain at home. Not far away Melody the Wood Thrush was pouring out his beautiful evening song. Whitefoot stopped to listen. Somehow it made him more unhappy than ever. Melody stopped singing for a few moments. It was just then that Whitefoot heard a faint sound. It was a gentle drumming. Whitefoot pricked up his ears and listened. There it was again. He knew instantly how that sound was made. It was made by dainty little feet beating very fast on an old log. Whitefoot had drummed that way himself many times. It was soft, but clear, and it lasted only a moment.</p>

<p>Right then something very strange happened to Whitefoot. Yes, sir, something very strange happened to Whitefoot. All in a flash he felt better. At first he didn&rsquo;t know why. He just did, that was all. Without thinking what he was doing, he began to drum himself. Then he listened. At first he heard nothing. Then, soft and low, came that drumming sound again. Whitefoot replied to it. All the time he kept feeling better. He ran a little nearer to the place from which that drumming sound had come and then once more drummed. At first he got no reply.</p>

<p>Then in a few minutes he heard it again, only this time it came from a different place. Whitefoot became quite excited. He knew that that drumming was done by another Wood Mouse, and all in a flash it came over him what had been the matter with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been lonely!&rdquo; exclaimed Whitefoot. &ldquo;That is all that has been the trouble with me. I have been lonely and didn&rsquo;t know it. I wonder if that other Wood Mouse has felt the same way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again he drummed and again came that soft reply. Once more Whitefoot hurried in the direction of it, and once more he was disappointed when the next reply came from a different place. By now he was getting quite excited. He was bound to find that other Wood Mouse. Every time he heard that drumming, funny little thrills ran all over him. He didn&rsquo;t know why. They just did, that was all. He simply must find that other Wood Mouse. He forgot everything else. He didn&rsquo;t even notice where he was going. He would drum, then wait for a reply. As soon as he heard it, he would scamper in the direction of it, and then pause to drum again. Sometimes the reply would be very near, then again it would be so far away that a great fear would fill Whitefoot&rsquo;s heart that the stranger was running away.</p>

<p></p>

<p>CHAPTER XXVI: Love Fills The Heart Of Whitefoot</p>

<p>   Joyous all the winds that blow    To the heart with love aglow.     &ndash;Whitefoot.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful game of hide-and-seek that Whitefoot the Wood Mouse was playing in the dusk of early evening. Whitefoot was &ldquo;it&rdquo; all the time. That is, he was the one who had to do all the hunting. Just who he was hunting for he didn&rsquo;t know. He knew it was another Wood Mouse, but it was a stranger, and do what he would, he couldn&rsquo;t get so much as a glimpse of this little stranger. He would drum with his feet and after a slight pause there would be an answering drum. Then Whitefoot would run as fast as he could in that direction only to find no one at all. Then he would drum again and the reply would come from another direction.</p>

<p>Every moment Whitefoot became more excited. He forgot everything, even danger, in his desire to see that little drummer. Once or twice he actually lost his temper in his disappointment. But this was only for a moment. He was too eager to find that little drummer to be angry very long.</p>

<p>At last there came a time when there was no reply to his drumming. He drummed and listened, then drummed again and listened. Nothing was to be heard. There was no reply. Whitefoot&rsquo;s heart sank.</p>

<p>All the old lonesomeness crept over him again. He didn&rsquo;t know which way to turn to look for that stranger. When he had drummed until he was tired, he sat on the end of an old log, a perfect picture of disappointment. He was so disappointed that he could have cried if it would have done any good.</p>

<p>Just as he had about made up his mind that there was nothing to do but to try to find his way home, his keen little ears caught the faintest rustle of dry leaves. Instantly Whitefoot was alert and watchful. Long ago he had learned to be suspicious of rustling leaves. They might have been rustled by the feet of an enemy stealing up on him. No Wood Mouse who wants to live long is ever heedless of rustling leaves. As still as if he couldn&rsquo;t move, Whitefoot sat staring at the place from which that faint sound had seemed to come. For two or three minutes he heard and saw nothing. Then another leaf rustled a little bit to one side. Whitefoot turned like a flash, his feet gathered under him ready for a long jump for safety.</p>

<p>At first he saw nothing. Then he became aware of two bright, soft little eyes watching him. He stared at them very hard and then all over him crept those funny thrills he had felt when he had first heard the drumming of the stranger. He knew without being told that those eyes belonged to the little drummer with whom he had been playing hide and seek so long.</p>

<p>Whitefoot held his breath, he was so afraid that those eyes would vanish. Finally he rather timidly jumped down from the log and started toward those two soft eyes. They vanished. Whitefoot&rsquo;s heart sank. He was tempted to rush forward, but he didn&rsquo;t. He sat still. There was a slight rustle off to the right. A little ray of moonlight made its way down through the branches of the trees just there, and in the middle of the light spot it made sat a timid little person. It seemed to Whitefoot that he was looking at the most beautiful Wood Mouse in all the Great World. Suddenly he felt very shy and timid himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&ndash;who&ndash;who are you?&rdquo; he stammered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am little Miss Dainty,&rdquo; replied the stranger bashfully.</p>

<p>Right then and there Whitefoot&rsquo;s heart was filled so full of something that it seemed as if it would burst. It was love. All in that instant he knew that he had found the most wonderful thing in all the Great World, which of course is love. He knew that he just couldn&rsquo;t live without little Miss Dainty.</p>

<p></p>

<p>CHAPTER XXVII: Mr. And Mrs. Whitefoot</p>

<p>   When all is said and all is done    'Tis only love of two makes one.     &ndash;Whitefoot.</p>

<p>Little Miss Dainty, the most beautiful and wonderful Wood Mouse in all the Great World, according to Whitefoot, was very shy and very timid. It took Whitefoot a long time to make her believe that he really couldn&rsquo;t live without her. At least, she pretended not to believe it. If the truth were known, little Miss Dainty felt just the same way about Whitefoot. But Whitefoot didn&rsquo;t know this, and I am afraid she teased him a great deal before she told him that she loved him just as he loved her.</p>

<p>But at last little Miss Dainty shyly admitted that she loved Whitefoot just as much as he loved her and was willing to become Mrs. Whitefoot. Secretly she thought Whitefoot the most wonderful Wood Mouse in the Great World, but she didn&rsquo;t tell him so. The truth is, she made him feel as if she were doing him a great favor.</p>

<p>As for Whitefoot, he was so happy that he actually tried to sing. Yes, sir, Whitefoot tried to sing, and he really did very well for a Mouse. He was ready and eager to do anything that Mrs. Whitefoot wanted to do. Together they scampered about in the moonlight, hunting for good things to eat, and poking their inquisitive little noses into every little place they could find. Whitefoot forgot that he had ever been sad and lonely. He raced about and did all sorts of funny things from pure joy, but he never once forgot to watch out for danger. In fact he was more watchful than ever, for now he was watching for Mrs. Whitefoot as well as for himself.</p>

<p>At last Whitefoot rather timidly suggested that they should go see his fine home in a certain hollow stub. Mrs. Whitefoot insisted that they should go to her home. Whitefoot agreed on condition that she would afterwards visit his home. So together they went back to Mrs. Whitefoot&rsquo;s home. Whitefoot pretended that he liked it very much, but in his heart he thought his own home was very much better, and he felt quite sure that Mrs. Whitefoot would agree with him once she had seen it.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Whitefoot was very well satisfied with her old home and not at all anxious to leave it. It was in an old hollow stump close to the ground. It was just such a place as Shadow the Weasel would be sure to visit should he happen along that way. It didn&rsquo;t seem at all safe to Whitefoot. In fact it worried him. Then, too, it was not in such a pleasant place as was his own home. Of course he didn&rsquo;t say this, but pretended to admire everything.</p>

<p>Two days and nights they spent there. Then Whitefoot suggested that they should visit his home. &ldquo;Of course, my dear, we will not have to live there unless you want to, but I want you to see it,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>Mrs. Whitefoot didn&rsquo;t appear at all anxious to go. She began to make excuses for staying right where they were. You see, she had a great love for that old home. They were sitting just outside the doorway talking about the matter when Whitefoot caught a glimpse of a swiftly moving form not far off. It was Shadow the Weasel. Neither of them breathed. Shadow passed without looking in their direction. When he was out of sight, Mrs. Whitefoot shivered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go over to your home right away,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen Shadow about here before, but now that he has been here once, he may come again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll start at once,&rdquo; replied Whitefoot, and for once he was glad that Shadow the Weasel was about.</p>

<p></p>

<p>CHAPTER XVIII: Mrs. Whitefoot Decides On A Home</p>

<p>   When Mrs. Mouse makes up her mind    Then Mr. Mouse best get behind.     &ndash;Whitefoot.</p>

<p>Whitefoot the Wood Mouse was very proud of his home. He showed it as he led Mrs. Whitefoot there. He felt sure that she would say at once that that would be the place for them to live. You remember that it was high up in a tall, dead stub and had once been the home of Katie the Flying Squirrel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, my dear, what do you think of that?&rdquo; said Whitefoot proudly as they reached the little round doorway.</p>

<p>Mrs. Whitefoot said nothing, but at once went inside. She was gone what seemed a long time to Whitefoot, anxiously waiting outside. You see, Mrs. Whitefoot is a very thorough small person, and she was examining the inside of that house from top to bottom. At last she appeared at the doorway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think this is a splendid house?&rdquo; asked Whitefoot rather timidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very good of its kind,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Whitefoot.</p>

<p>Whitefoot&rsquo;s heart sank. He didn&rsquo;t like the tone in which Mrs. Whitefoot had said that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just what do you mean, my dear?&rdquo; Whitefoot asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Whitefoot, in a most decided way, &ldquo;that it is a very good house for winter, but it won&rsquo;t do at all for summer. That is, it won&rsquo;t do for me. In the first place it is so high up that if we should have babies, I would worry all the time for fear the darlings would have a bad fall. Besides, I don&rsquo;t like an inside house for summer. I think, Whitefoot, we must look around and find a new home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she spoke Mrs. Whitefoot was already starting down the stub. Whitefoot followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, my dear, all right,&rdquo; said he meekly. &ldquo;You know best. This seems to me like a very fine home, but of course, if you don&rsquo;t like it we&rsquo;ll look for another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Whitefoot said nothing, but led the way down the tree with Whitefoot meekly following. Then began a patient search all about. Mrs. Whitefoot appeared to know just what she wanted and turned up her nose at several places Whitefoot thought would make fine homes. She hardly glanced at a fine hollow log Whitefoot found. She merely poked her nose in at a splendid hole beneath the roots of an old stump. Whitefoot began to grow tired from running about and climbing stumps and trees and bushes.</p>

<p>He stopped to rest and lost sight of Mrs. Whitefoot. A moment later he heard her calling excitedly. When he found her, she was up in a small tree, sitting on the edge of an old nest a few feet above the ground. It was a nest that had once belonged to Melody the Wood Thrush. Mrs. Whitefoot was sitting on the edge of it, and her bright eyes snapped with excitement and pleasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found it!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found it! It is just what I have been looking for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Found what?&rdquo; Whitefoot asked. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything but an old nest of Melody&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found the home we&rsquo;ve been looking for, stupid,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Whitefoot.</p>

<p>Still Whitefoot stared. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any house,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>Mrs. Whitefoot stamped her feet impatiently. &ldquo;Right here, stupid,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;This old nest will make us the finest and safest home that ever was. No one will ever think of looking for us here. We must get busy at once and fix it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even then Whitefoot didn&rsquo;t understand. Always he had lived either in a hole in the ground, or in a hollow stump or tree. How they were to live in that old nest he couldn&rsquo;t see at all.</p>

<p></p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIX: Making Over An Old House</p>

<p>   A home is always what you make it.    With love there you will ne'er forsake it.     &ndash;Whitefoot.</p>

<p>Whitefoot climbed up to the old nest of Melody the Wood Thrush over the edge of which little Mrs. Whitefoot was looking down at him. It took Whitefoot hardly a moment to get up there, for the nest was only a few feet above the ground in a young tree, and you know Whitefoot is a very good climber.</p>

<p>He found Mrs. Whitefoot very much excited. She was delighted with that old nest and she showed it. For his part, Whitefoot couldn&rsquo;t see anything but a deserted old house of no use to any one. To be sure, it had been a very good home in its time. It had been made of tiny twigs, stalks of old weeds, leaves, little fine roots and mud. It was still quite solid, and was firmly fixed in a crotch of the young tree. But Whitefoot couldn&rsquo;t see how it could be turned into a home for a Mouse. He said as much.</p>

<p>Little Mrs. Whitefoot became more excited than ever. &ldquo;You dear old stupid,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;whatever is the matter with you? Don&rsquo;t you see that all we need do is to put a roof on, make an entrance on the under side, and make a soft comfortable bed inside to make it a delightful home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why we don&rsquo;t make a new home altogether,&rdquo; protested Whitefoot. &ldquo;It seems to me that hollow stub of mine is ever so much better than this. That has good solid walls, and we won&rsquo;t have to do a thing to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you once before that it doesn&rsquo;t suit me for summer,&rdquo; replied little Mrs. Whitefoot rather sharply, because she was beginning to lose patience. &ldquo;It will be all right for winter, but winter is a long way off. It may suit you for summer, but it doesn&rsquo;t suit me, and this place does. So this is where we are going to live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, my dear. Certainly,&rdquo; replied Whitefoot very meekly. &ldquo;If you want to live here, here we will live. But I must confess it isn&rsquo;t clear to me yet how we are going to make a decent home out of this old nest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about that,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Whitefoot. &ldquo;You can get the material, and I&rsquo;ll attend to the rest. Let us waste no time about it. I am anxious to get our home finished and to feel a little bit settled. I have already planned just what has got to be done and how we will do it. Now you go look for some nice soft, dry weed stalks and strips of soft bark, and moss and any other soft, tough material that you can find. Just get busy and don&rsquo;t stop to talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course Whitefoot did as he was told. He ran down to the ground and began to hunt for the things Mrs. Whitefoot wanted. He was very particular about it. He still didn&rsquo;t think much of her idea of making over that old home of Melody&rsquo;s, but if she would do it, he meant that she should have the very best of materials to do it with.</p>

<p>So back and forth from the ground to the old nest in the tree Whitefoot hurried, and presently there was quite a pile of weed stalks and soft grass and strips of bark in the old nest. Mrs. Whitefoot joined Whitefoot in hunting for just the right things, but she spent more time in arranging the material. Over that old nest she made a fine high roof. Down through the lower side she cut a little round doorway just big enough for them to pass through. Unless you happened to be underneath looking up, you never would have guessed there was an entrance at all. Inside was a snug, round room, and in this she made the softest and most comfortable of beds. As it began to look more and more like a home, Whitefoot himself became as excited and eager as Mrs. Whitefoot had been from the beginning. &ldquo;It certainly is going to be a fine home,&rdquo; said Whitefoot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you it would be?&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Whitefoot.</p>

<p></p>

<p>CHAPTER XXX: The Whitefoots Enjoy Their New Home</p>

<p>   No home is ever mean or poor    Where love awaits you at the door.     &ndash;Whitefoot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Mrs. Whitefoot, as she worked a strip of white birch bark into the roof of the new home she and Whitefoot had been building out of the old home of Melody the Wood Thrush, &ldquo;this finishes the roof. I don&rsquo;t think any water will get through it even in the hardest rain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is wonderful,&rdquo; declared Whitefoot admiringly. &ldquo;Wherever did you learn to build such a house as this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From my mother,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Whitefoot. &ldquo;I was born in just such a home. It makes the finest kind of a home for Wood Mouse babies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think there is danger that the wind will blow it down, do you?&rdquo; ventured Whitefoot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted little Mrs. Whitefoot scornfully. &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t this old nest remained right where it is for over a year? Do you suppose that if I had thought there was the least bit of danger that it would blow down, I would have used it? Do credit me with a little sense, my dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m, I do,&rdquo; replied Whitefoot meekly. &ldquo;You are the most sensible person in all the Great World. I wasn&rsquo;t finding fault. You see, I have always lived in a hole in the ground or a hollow stump, or a hole in a tree, and I have not yet become used to a home that moves about and rocks as this one does when the wind blows. But if you say it is all right, why of course it is all right. Probably I will get used to it after awhile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whitefoot did get used to it. After living in it for a few days, it no longer seemed strange, and he no longer minded its swaying when the wind blew. The fact is, he rather enjoyed it. So Whitefoot and Mrs. Whitefoot settled down to enjoy their new home. Now and then they added a bit to it here and there.</p>

<p>Somehow Whitefoot felt unusually safe, safer than he had ever felt in any of his other homes. You see, he had seen several feathered folk alight close to it and not give it a second look. He knew that they had seen that home, but had mistaken it for what it had once been, the deserted home of one of their own number.</p>

<p>Whitefoot had chuckled. He had chuckled long and heartily. &ldquo;If they make that mistake,&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;everybody else is likely to make it. That home of ours is right in plain sight, yet I do believe it is safer than the best hidden home I ever had before. Shadow the Weasel never will think of climbing up this little tree to look at an old nest, and Shadow is the one I am most afraid of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was only a day or two later that Buster Bear happened along that way. Now Buster is very fond of tender Wood Mouse. More than once Whitefoot had had a narrow escape from Buster&rsquo;s big claws as they tore open an old stump or dug into the ground after him. He saw Buster glance up at the new home without the slightest interest in those shrewd little eyes of his. Then Buster shuffled on to roll over an old log and lick up the ants he found under it. Again Whitefoot chuckled. &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It is the safest home I &rsquo;ve ever had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Whitefoot and little Mrs. Whitefoot were very happy in the home which they had built, and for once in his life Whitefoot did very little worrying. Life seemed more beautiful than it had ever been before. And he almost forgot that there was such a thing as a hungry enemy.</p>

<p></p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXI: Whitefoot Is Hurt</p>

<p>   The hurts that hardest are to bear    Come from those for whom we care.     &ndash;Whitefoot.</p>

<p>Whitefoot was hurt. Yes, sir, Whitefoot was hurt. He was very much hurt. It wasn&rsquo;t a bodily hurt; it was an inside hurt. It was a hurt that made his heart ache. And to make it worse, he couldn&rsquo;t understand it at all. One evening he had been met at the little round doorway by little Mrs. Whitefoot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t come in,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; demanded Whitefoot, in the greatest surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind why. You can&rsquo;t, and that is all there is to it,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Whitefoot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean I can&rsquo;t ever come in any more?&rdquo; asked Whitefoot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Whitefoot, &ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t come in now, nor for some time. I think the best thing you can do is to go back to your old home in the hollow stub.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whitefoot stared at little Mrs. Whitefoot quite as if he thought she had gone crazy. Then he lost his temper. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll come in if I want to,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;This home is quite as much my home as it is yours. You have no right to keep me out of it. Just you get out of my way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But little Mrs. Whitefoot didn&rsquo;t get out of his way, and do what he would, Whitefoot couldn&rsquo;t get in. You see she quite filled that little round doorway. Finally, he had to give up trying. Three times he came back and each time he found little Mrs. Whitefoot in the doorway. And each time she drove him away. Finally, for lack of any other place to go to, he returned to his old home in the old stub. Once he had thought this the finest home possible, but now somehow it didn&rsquo;t suit him at all. The truth is he missed little Mrs. Whitefoot, and so what had once been a home was now only a place in which to hide and sleep.</p>

<p>Whitefoot&rsquo;s anger did not last long. It was replaced by that hurt feeling. He felt that he must have done something little Mrs. Whitefoot did not like, but though he thought and thought he couldn&rsquo;t remember a single thing. Several times he went back to see if Mrs. Whitefoot felt any differently, but found she didn&rsquo;t. Finally she told him rather sharply to go away and stay away. After that Whitefoot didn&rsquo;t venture over to the new home. He would sometimes sit a short distance away and gaze at it longingly. All the joy had gone out of the beautiful springtime for him. He was quite as unhappy as he had been before he met little Mrs. Whitefoot. You see, he was even more lonely than he had been then. And added to this loneliness was that hurt feeling, which made it ever and ever so much worse. It was very hard to bear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I could understand it, it wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad,&rdquo; he kept saying over and over again to himself, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t understand it. I don&rsquo;t understand why Mrs. Whitefoot doesn&rsquo;t love me any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p></p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXII: The Surprise</p>

<p>   Surprises sometimes are so great    You&rsquo;re tempted to believe in fate.     &ndash;Whitefoot.</p>

<p>One never-to-be forgotten evening Whitefoot met Mrs. Whitefoot and she invited him to come back to their home. Of course Whitefoot was delighted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sh-h-h,&rdquo; said little Mrs. Whitefoot, as Whitefoot entered the snug little room of the house they had built in the old nest of Melody the Wood Thrush. Whitefoot hesitated. In the first place, it was dark in there. In the second place, he had the feeling that somehow that little bedroom seemed crowded. It hadn&rsquo;t been that way the last time he was there. Mrs. Whitefoot was right in front of him, and she seemed very much excited about something.</p>

<p>Presently she crowded to one side. &ldquo;Come here and look,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>Whitefoot looked. In the middle of a soft bed of moss was a squirming mass of legs and funny little heads. At first that was all Whitefoot could make out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think this is the most wonderful surprise that ever was?&rdquo; whispered little Mrs. Whitefoot. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they darlings? Aren&rsquo;t you proud of them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time Whitefoot had made out that that squirming mass of legs and heads was composed of baby Mice. He counted them. There were four. &ldquo;Whose are they, and what are they doing here?&rdquo; Whitefoot asked in a queer voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you old stupid, they are yours,&ndash;yours and mine,&rdquo; declared little Mrs. Whitefoot. &ldquo;Did you ever, ever see such beautiful babies? Now I guess you understand why I kept you away from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whitefoot shook his head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand at all. I don&rsquo;t see yet what you drove me away for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you blessed old dear, there wasn&rsquo;t room for you when those babies came; I had to have all the room there was. It wouldn&rsquo;t have done to have had you running in and out and disturbing them when they were so tiny. I had to be alone with them, and that is why I made you go off and live by yourself. I am so proud of them, I don&rsquo;t know what to do. Aren&rsquo;t you proud, Whitefoot? Aren&rsquo;t you the proudest Wood Mouse in all the Green Forest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course Whitefoot should have promptly said that he was, but the truth is, Whitefoot wasn&rsquo;t proud at all. You see, he was so surprised that he hadn&rsquo;t yet had time to feel that they were really his. In fact, just then he felt a wee bit jealous of them. It came over him that they would take all the time and attention of little Mrs. Whitefoot. So Whitefoot didn&rsquo;t answer that question. He simply sat and stared at those four squirming babies.</p>

<p>Finally little Mrs. Whitefoot gently pushed him out and followed him. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t room for you to stay here now. You will have to sleep in your old home because there isn&rsquo;t room in here for both of us and the babies too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whitefoot&rsquo;s heart sank. He had thought that he was to stay and that everything would be just as it had been before. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I come over here any more?&rdquo; he asked rather timidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a foolish question!&rdquo; cried little Mrs. Whitefoot. &ldquo;Of course you can. You will have to help take care of these babies. Just as soon as they are big enough, you will have to help teach them how to hunt for food and how to watch out for danger, and all the things that a wise Wood Mouse knows. Why, they couldn&rsquo;t get along without you. Neither could I,&rdquo; she added softly.</p>

<p>At that Whitefoot felt better. And suddenly there was a queer swelling in his heart. It was the beginning of pride, pride in those wonderful babies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have given me the best surprise that ever was, my dear,&rdquo; said Whitefoot softly. &ldquo;Now I think I will go and look for some supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So now we will leave Whitefoot and his family. You see there are two very lively little people of the Green Forest who demand attention and insist on having it. They are Buster Bear&rsquo;s Twins, and this is to be the title of the next book.</p>

<p>  <h2 id="ch1"><a href="#ch1"><span>I</span> Dani Meadow Mouse Is Worried</a></h2></p>

<p>  <aside class="illo">     <figure>       <img src="images/dani/dani-and-mrs-toad.jpg" />       <figcaption>Old Mrs. Toad gave Dani some good advice.</figcaption>     </figure>   </aside></p>

<p>  <p>Dani Meadow Mouse sat on her doorstep with her chin in her hands, and it was very plain to see that Dani had something on her mind. She had only a nod for Jenny Skunk, and even Peter Rabbit could get no more than a grumpy “Good morning.” It wasn’t that she had been caught napping the day before by Reddy Fox and nearly made an end of. No, it wasn’t that. Dani had learned her lesson, and Reddy would never catch her again. It wasn’t that she was all alone with no one to play with. Dani was rather glad that she was alone. The fact is, Dani Meadow Mouse was worried.</p>      <p>Now worry is one of the worst things in the world, and it didn’t seem as if there was anything that Dani Meadow Mouse need worry about. But you know it is the easiest thing in the world to find something to worry over and make yourself uncomfortable about. And when you make yourself uncomfortable, you are almost sure to make everyone around you equally uncomfortable. It was so with Dani Meadow Mouse. Striped Chipmunk had twice called her “Cross Patch” that morning, and Johnny Chuck, who had fought Reddy Fox for her the day before, had called her “Grumpy.” And what do you think was the matter with Dani Meadow Mouse? Why, she was worrying because her tail was short. Yes, sir, that is all that ailed Dani Meadow Mouse that bright morning.</p>      <p>You know some people let their looks make them miserable. They worry because they are homely or freckled, or short or tall, or thin or stout, all of which is very foolish. And Dani Meadow Mouse was just as foolish in worrying because her tail was short.</p>      <p>It is short! It certainly is all of that! Dani never had realized how short until she chanced to meet her cousin Whitefoot, who lives in the Green Forest. He was very elegantly dressed, but the most imposing thing about him was his long, slim, beautiful tail. Dani had at once become conscious of her own stubby little tail, and she had hardly had pride enough to hold her head up as became an honest Meadow Mouse. Ever since, she had been thinking and thinking, and wondering how her family came to have such short tails. Then she grew envious and began to wish and wish and wish that she could have a long tail like her cousin Whitefoot.</p>      <p>She was so busy wishing that she had a long tail, that she quite forgot to take care of the tail she did have, and she pretty nearly lost it — and her life with it. Old Whitetail the Marsh Hawk spied Dani sitting there moping on her doorstep, and came sailing over the tops of the meadow grasses so softly that he all but caught Dani. If it hadn’t been for one of the Merry Little Breezes, Dani would have been caught. And all because she was envious. It’s a bad, bad habit.</p></p>

<p>   <h2 id="ch2"><a href="#ch2"><span>II</span> Dani Meadow Mouse and her Short Tail</a></h2></p>

<p>  <p>All Dani Meadow Mouse could think about was her short tail. She was so ashamed of it that whenever anyone passed, she crawled out of sight so that they should not see how short her tail was. Instead of playing in the sunshine as she used to do, she sat and sulked. Pretty soon her friends began to pass without stopping. Finally one day Old Mrs. Toad sat down in front of Dani and began to ask questions.</p></p>

<p>  <p class="q">“What’s the matter?” asked Old Mrs. Toad.</p>      <p class="q">“Nothing,” replied Dani Meadow Mouse.</p>      <p class="q">“I don’t suppose there really is anything the matter, but what do you think is the matter?” said Old Mrs. Toad.</p>      <p>Dani fidgeted, and Old Mrs. Toad looked up at jolly, round, red Mr. Sun and winked. “Sun is just as bright as ever, isn’t it?” she inquired.</p>      <p class="q">“Yes,” said Dani.</p>      <p class="q">“Got plenty to eat and drink, haven’t you?” continued Mrs. Toad.</p>      <p class="q">“Yes,” said Dani.</p>      <p class="q">“Seems to me that that is a pretty good-looking suit of clothes you’re wearing,” said Mrs. Toad, eyeing Dani critically. “Sunny weather, plenty to eat and drink, and good clothes — must be you don’t know when you’re well off, Dani Meadow Mouse.”</p>      <p>Dani hung her head. Finally she looked up and caught a kindly twinkle in Old Mrs. Toad’s eyes. “Mrs. Toad, how can I get a long tail like my cousin Whitefoot of the Green Forest?” she asked.</p>      <p class="q">“So that’s what’s the matter! Ha! ha! ha! Dani Meadow Mouse, I’m ashamed of you! I certainly am ashamed of you!” said Mrs. Toad. “What good would a long tail do you? Tell me that.”</p>      <p>For a minute Dani didn’t know just what to say. “I—I—I’d look so much better if I had a long tail,” she ventured.</p>      <p>Old Mrs. Toad just laughed. “You never saw a Meadow Mouse with a long tail, did you? Of course not. What a sight it would be! Why, everybody on the Green Meadows would laugh themselves sick at the sight! You see you need to be slim and trim and handsome to carry a long tail well. And then what a nuisance it would be! You would always have to be thinking of your tail and taking care to keep it out of harm’s way. Look at me. I’m homely. Some folks call me ugly to look at. But no one tries to catch me as Farmer Brown’s girl does Billy Mink because of his fine coat; and no one wants to put me in a cage because of a fine voice. I am satisfied to be just as I am, and if you’ll take my advice, Dani Meadow Mouse, you’ll be satisfied to be just as you are.”</p>      <p class="q">“Perhaps you are right,” said Dani Meadow Mouse after a little. “I’ll try.”</p>         <h2 id="ch3"><a href="#ch3"><span>III</span> Dani Meadow Mouse Plays Hide and Seek</a></h2>      <p>Life is always a game of hide and seek to Dani Meadow Mouse. You see, she is such a fat little thing that there are a great many other furry-coated people, and almost as many who wear feathers, who would gobble Dani up for breakfast or for dinner if they could. Some of them pretend to be her friends, but Dani always keeps her eyes open when they are around and always begins to play hide and seek. Peter Rabbit and Jenny Skunk and Striped Chipmunk and Happy Jill Squirrel are all friends whom she can trust, but she always has a bright twinkling eye open for Reddy Fox and Billy Mink and Shadow the Weasel and old Whitetail the Marsh Hawk, and several more, especially Hooty the Owl at night.</p>      <p>Now Dani Meadow Mouse is stout-hearted, and when rough Brother North Wind came shouting across the Green Meadows, tearing to pieces the snow clouds and shaking out the snowflakes until they covered the Green Meadows deep, deep, deep, Dani just snuggled down in her warm coat in her snug little house of grass and waited. Dani liked the snow. Yes, sir, Dani Meadow Mouse liked the snow. She just loved to dig in it and make tunnels. Through those tunnels in every direction she could go where she pleased and when she pleased without being seen by anybody. It was great fun!</p>      <p>Every little way she made a little round doorway up beside a stiff stalk of grass. Out of this she could peep at the white world, and she could get the fresh cold air. Sometimes, when she was quite sure that no one was around, she would scamper across on top of the snow from one doorway to another, and when she did this, she made the prettiest little footprints.</p>      <p>Now Reddy Fox knew all about those doorways and who made them. Reddy was having hard work to get enough to eat in this cold weather, and he was hungry most of the time. One morning, as he came tiptoeing softly over the meadows, what should he see just ahead of him but the head of Dani Meadow Mouse pop out of one of those little round doorways. Reddy’s mouth watered, and he stole forward more softly than ever. When he got within jumping distance, he drew his stout hind legs under him and made ready to spring. Presto! Dani Meadow Mouse had disappeared! Reddy Fox jumped just the same and began to dig as fast as he could make his paws go. He could smell Dani Meadow Mouse and that made him almost frantic.</p>      <p>All the time Dani Meadow Mouse was scurrying along one of her little tunnels, and when finally Reddy Fox stopped digging because he was quite out of breath, Dani popped her head out of another little doorway and laughed at Reddy. Of course Reddy saw her, and of course Reddy tried to catch her there, and dug frantically just as before. And of course Dani Meadow Mouse wasn’t there.</p>      <p>After a while Reddy Fox grew tired of this kind of game and tried another plan. The next time he saw Dani Meadow Mouse stick her head out, Reddy pretended not to see her. He stretched himself out on the ground and made believe that he was very tired and sleepy. He closed his eyes. Then he opened them just the tiniest bit, so that he could see Dani Meadow Mouse and yet seem to be asleep. Dani watched him for a long time. Then she chuckled to herself and dropped out of sight.</p>      <p>No sooner was she gone than Reddy Fox stole over close to the little doorway and waited. “She’ll surely stick her head out again to see if I’m asleep, and then I’ll have her,” said Reddy to himself. So he waited and waited and waited. By and by he turned his head. There was Dani Meadow Mouse at another little doorway laughing at him!</p></p>

<p></section></p>

<p> <section class="chapter-set"></p>

<p><h2 id="ch4"><a href="#ch4"><span>IV</span> Old Granny Fox Tries for Dani Meadow Mouse</a></h2></p>

<p><aside class="illo">   <figure>     <img src="images/dani/fox-in-the-tunnel.jpg" />     <figcaption>Plunge! Granny Fox tries to catch Dani.</figcaption>   </figure> </aside></p>

<p><p>Dani Meadow Mouse had not enjoyed anything so much for a long time as she did that game of hide and seek. She tickled and chuckled all the afternoon as she thought about it. Of course Reddy had been “it.” He had been “it” all the time, for never once had he caught Dani Meadow Mouse. If he had — well, there wouldn’t have been any more stories about Dani Meadow Mouse, because there wouldn’t have been any Dani Meadow Mouse any more.</p></p>

<p><p>But Dani never let herself think about this. She had enjoyed the game all the more because it had been such a dangerous game. It had been such fun to dive into one of her little round doorways in the snow, run along one of her own little tunnels, and then peep out at another doorway and watch Reddy Fox digging as fast as ever he could at the doorway Dani had just left. Finally Reddy had given up in disgust and gone off muttering angrily to try to find something else for dinner. Dani had sat up on the snow and watched him go. In her funny little squeaky voice Dani shouted:</p></p>

<p><blockquote>   <p class="q">     “Though Reddy Fox is smart and sly,<br>     Hi-hum-diddle-de-o!<br>     I’m just as smart and twice as spry.<br>     Hi-hum-diddle-de-o!”   </p> </blockquote></p>

<p><p>That night Reddy Fox told old Granny Fox all about how he had tried to catch Dani Meadow Mouse. Granny listened with her head cocked on one side. When Reddy told how fat Dani Meadow Mouse was, her mouth watered. You see now that snow covered the Green Meadows and the Green Forest, Granny and Reddy Fox had hard work to get enough to eat, and they were hungry most of the time.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“I’ll go with you down on the meadows tomorrow morning, and then we’ll see if Dani Meadow Mouse is as smart as she thinks she is,” said Granny Fox.</p></p>

<p><p>So, bright and early the next morning, old Granny Fox and Reddy Fox went down on the meadows where Dani Meadow Mouse lives. Dani had felt in her bones that Reddy would come back, so she was watching, and she saw them as soon as they came out of the Green Forest. When she saw old Granny Fox, Dani’s heart beat a little faster than before, for she knew that Granny Fox is very smart and very wise and has learned most of the tricks of all the other little meadow and forest people.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“This is going to be a more exciting game than the other,” said Dani to herself, and scurried down out of sight to see that all her little tunnels were clear so that she could run fast through them if she had to. Then she peeped out of one of her little doorways hidden in a clump of tall grass.</p></p>

<p><p>Old Granny Fox set Reddy to hunting for Dani’s little round doorways, and as fast as he found them, Granny came up and sniffed at each. Dani knew that she could tell by the smell which one she had been at last. Finally she came straight towards the tall bunch of grass. Dani ducked down and scurried along one of her little tunnels. She heard Granny Fox sniff at the doorway she had just left. Suddenly something plunged down through the snow right at her very heels. Dani didn’t have to look to know that it was Granny Fox herself, and she squeaked with fright.</p></p>

<p> <h2 id="ch5"><a href="#ch5"><span>V</span> What Happened on the Green Meadows</a></h2></p>

<p><p>Thick and fast things were happening to Dani Meadow Mouse down on the snow-covered Green Meadows. Rather, they were almost happening. She hadn’t minded when Reddy Fox all alone tried to catch her. Indeed, she had made a regular game of hide and seek of it and had enjoyed it immensely. But now it was different. Granny Fox wasn’t so easily fooled as Reddy Fox. Just Granny alone would have made the game dangerous for Dani Meadow Mouse. But Reddy was with her, and so Dani had two to look out for, and she got so many frights that it seemed to her as if her heart had moved right up into her mouth and was going to stay there. Yes, sir, that is just how it seemed.</p></p>

<p><p>Down in her little tunnels underneath the snow Dani Meadow Mouse felt perfectly safe from Reddy Fox, who would stop and dig frantically at the little round doorway where he had last seen Dani. But old Granny Fox knew all about those little tunnels, and she didn’t waste any time digging at the doorways. Instead she cocked her sharp little ears and listened with all her might. Now Granny Fox has very keen ears, oh, very keen ears, and she heard just what she hoped she would hear. She heard Dani Meadow Mouse running along one of her little tunnels under the snow.</p></p>

<p><p><em>Plunge!</em> Old Granny Fox dived right into the snow and right through into the tunnel of Dani Meadow Mouse. Her two black paws actually touched Dani’s tail. Dani was glad then that it was no longer.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“Ha!” cried Granny Fox, “I almost got her that time!”</p></p>

<p><p>Then she ran ahead a little way over the snow, listening as before. <em>Plunge!</em> Into the snow she went again. It was lucky for her that Dani had just turned into another tunnel, for otherwise she would surely have caught her.</p></p>

<p><p>Granny Fox blew the snow out of her nose. “Next time I’ll get her!” said she.</p></p>

<p><p>Now Reddy Fox is quick to learn, especially when it is a way to get something to eat. He watched Granny Fox, and when he understood what she was doing, he made up his mind to have a try himself, for he was afraid that if she caught Dani Meadow Mouse, she would think that she was not big enough to divide. Perhaps that was because Reddy is very selfish himself. So the next time Granny plunged into the snow and missed Dani Meadow Mouse just as before, Reddy rushed in ahead of her, and the minute he heard Dani running down below, he plunged in just as he had seen Granny do. But he didn’t take the pains to make sure of just where Dani was, and so of course he didn’t come anywhere near her. But he frightened Dani still more and made old Granny Fox lose her temper.</p></p>

<p><p>Poor Dani Meadow Mouse! She had never been so frightened in all her life. She didn’t know which way to turn or where to run. And so she sat still, which, although she didn’t know it, was the very best thing she could do. When she sat still she made no noise, and so of course Granny and Reddy Fox could not tell where she was. Old Granny Fox sat and listened and listened and listened, and wondered where Dani Meadow Mouse was. And down under the snow Dani Meadow Mouse sat and listened and listened and listened, and wondered where Granny and Reddy Fox were.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“Pooh!” said Granny Fox after a while, “That Meadow Mouse thinks she can fool me by sitting still. I’ll give her a scare.”</p></p>

<p><p>Then she began to plunge into the snow this way and that way, and sure enough, pretty soon she landed so close to Dani Meadow Mouse that one of her claws scratched her.</p></p>

<p> <h2 id="ch6"><a href="#ch6"><span>VI</span> Dani Meadow Mouse Remembers and Reddy Fox Forgets</a></h2></p>

<p><p class="q">“There she goes!” cried old Granny Fox. “Don’t let her sit still again!”</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“I hear her!” shouted Reddy Fox, and plunged down into the snow just as Granny Fox had done a minute before. But he didn’t catch anything, and when he had blown the snow out of his nose and wiped it out of his eyes, he saw Granny Fox dive into the snow with no better luck.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“Never mind,” said Granny Fox, “As long as we keep her running, we can hear her, and some one of these times we’ll catch her. Pretty soon she’ll get too tired to be so spry, and when she is—” Granny didn’t finish, but licked her chops and smacked her lips. Reddy Fox grinned, then licked his chops and smacked his lips. Then once more they took turns diving into the snow.</p></p>

<p><p>And down underneath in the little tunnels she had made, Dani Meadow Mouse was running for her life. She was getting tired, just as old Granny Fox had said she would. She was almost out of breath. She was sore and one leg smarted, for in one of her jumps old Granny Fox had so nearly caught her that her claws had torn her pants and scratched her.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“Oh, dear! Oh, dear! If only I had time to think!” panted Dani Meadow Mouse, and then she squealed in still greater fright as Reddy Fox crashed down into her tunnel right at her very heels. “I’ve got to get somewhere! I’ve got to get somewhere where they can’t get at me!” she sobbed. And right that very instant she remembered the old fence-post!</p></p>

<p><p>The old fence-post lay on the ground and was hollow. Fastened to it were long wires with sharp cruel barbs. Dani had made a tunnel over to that old fence-post the very first day after the snow came, for in that hollow in the old post she had a secret store of seeds. Why hadn’t she thought of it before? It must have been because she was too frightened to think. But she remembered now, and she dodged into the tunnel that led to the old fence-post, running faster than ever, for though her heart was in her mouth from fear, in her heart was hope, and hope is a wonderful thing.</p></p>

<p><p>Now old Granny Fox knew all about that old fence-post and she remembered all about those barbed wires fastened to it. Although they were covered with snow she knew just about where they lay, and just before she reached them she stopped plunging down into the snow. Reddy Fox knew about those wires too, but he was so excited that he forgot all about them.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“Stop!” cried old Granny Fox sharply.</p></p>

<p><p>But Reddy Fox didn’t hear, or if he heard he didn’t heed. His sharp ears could hear Dani Meadow Mouse running almost underneath him. Granny Fox could stop if she wanted to, but he was going to have Dani Meadow Mouse for his breakfast! Down into the snow he plunged as hard as ever he could.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“Oh! Oh! Wow! Wow! Oh, dear! Oh, dear!”</p></p>

<p><p>That wasn’t the voice of Dani Meadow Mouse. Oh, my, no! It was the voice of Reddy Fox. Yes, sir, it was the voice of Reddy Fox. He had landed with one of his black paws right on one of those sharp wire barbs, and it did hurt dreadfully.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“I never did know a young Fox who could get into as much trouble as you can!” snapped old Granny Fox, as Reddy hobbled along on three legs behind her, across the snow-covered Green Meadows. “It serves you right for forgetting!”</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“Yes’m,” said Reddy meekly.</p></p>

<p><p>And safe in the hollow of the old fence-post, Dani Meadow Mouse was dressing the scratch on her leg made by the claws of old Granny Fox.</p></p>

<p></section></p>

<p> <section class="chapter-set"></p>

<p><h2 id="ch7"><a href="#ch7"><span>VII</span> Old Granny Fox Tries a New Plan</a></h2></p>

<p><aside class="illo">   <figure>     <img src="images/dani/hollow-fence-post.jpg" />     <figcaption>Safe in the hollow of the old fence-post.</figcaption>   </figure> </aside></p>

<p><p>Old Granny Fox kept thinking about Dani Meadow Mouse. She knew that she was fat, and it made her mouth water every time she thought of her. She made up her mind that she must and would have her. She knew that Dani had been very, very much frightened when she and Reddy Fox had tried so hard to catch her by plunging down through the snow into her little tunnels after her, and she felt pretty sure that she wouldn’t go far away from the old fence-post, in the hollow of which she was snug and safe.</p></p>

<p><p>Old Granny Fox is very smart. “Dani Meadow Mouse won’t put her nose out of that old fence-post for a day or two. Then she’ll get tired of staying inside all the time, and she’ll peep out of one of her little round doorways to see if the way is clear. If she doesn’t see any danger, she’ll come out and run around on top of the snow to get some of the seeds in the tops of the tall grasses that stick out through the snow. If nothing frightens her, she’ll keep going, a little farther and a little farther from that old fence-post. I must see to it that Dani Meadow Mouse isn’t frightened for a few days.” So said old Granny Fox to herself, as she lay under a hemlock tree, studying how she could best get the next meal.</p></p>

<p><p>Then she called Reddy Fox to her and forbade him to go down on the meadows until she should tell him he might. Reddy grumbled and mumbled and didn’t see why he shouldn’t go where he pleased, but he didn’t dare disobey. You see he had a sore foot. He had hurt it on a wire barb when he was plunging through the snow after Dani Meadow Mouse, and now he had to run on three legs. That meant that he must depend upon Granny Fox to help him get enough to eat. So Reddy didn’t dare to disobey.</p></p>

<p><p>It all came out just as Granny Fox had thought it would. Dani Meadow Mouse <em>did</em> get tired of staying in the old fence-post. She <em>did</em> peep out first, and then she <em>did</em> run a little way on the snow, and then a little farther and a little farther. But all the time she took great care not to get more than a jump or two from one of her little round doorways leading down to her tunnels under the snow.</p></p>

<p><p>Hidden on the edge of the Green Forest, Granny Fox watched her. She looked up at the sky, and she knew that it was going to snow again. “That’s good,” said she. “Tomorrow morning I’ll have fat Meadow Mouse for breakfast,” and she smiled a hungry smile.</p></p>

<p><p>The next morning, before jolly, round, red Mr. Sun was out of bed, old Granny Fox trotted down onto the meadows and straight over to where, down under the snow, lay the old fence-post. It had snowed again, and all the little doorways of Dani Meadow Mouse were covered up with soft, fleecy snow. Behind Granny Fox limped Reddy Fox, grumbling to himself.</p></p>

<p><p>When they reached the place where the old fence-post lay buried under the snow, old Granny Fox stretched out as flat as she could. Then she told Reddy to cover her up with the new soft snow. Reddy did as he was told, but all the time he grumbled. “Now you go off to the Green Forest and keep out of sight,” said Granny Fox. “By and by I’ll bring you some Meadow Mouse for your breakfast,” and Granny Fox chuckled to think how smart she was and how she was going to catch Dani Meadow Mouse.</p></p>

<p> <h2 id="ch8"><a href="#ch8"><span>VIII</span> Brother North Wind Proves a Friend</a></h2></p>

<p><p>Dani Meadow Mouse had seen nothing of old Granny Fox or Reddy Fox for several days. Every morning the first thing she did, even before she had breakfast, was to climb up to one of her little round doorways and peep out over the beautiful white meadows, to see if there was any danger near. But every time she did so, Dani used a different doorway. “For,” said Dani to herself, “if any one should happen, just happen, to see me this morning, they might be waiting just outside my doorway to catch me tomorrow morning.” You see there is a great deal of wisdom in the little head that Dani Meadow Mouse carries on her shoulders.</p></p>

<p><p>But the first day and the second day and the third day she saw nothing of old Granny Fox or of Reddy Fox, and she began to enjoy running through her tunnels under the snow and scurrying across from one doorway to another on top of the snow, just as she had before the Foxes had tried so hard to catch her. But she hadn’t forgotten, as Granny Fox had hoped she would. No, indeed, Dani Meadow Mouse hadn’t forgotten. She was too wise for that.</p></p>

<p><p>One morning, when she started to climb up to one of her little doorways, she found that it was closed. Yes, sir, it was closed. In fact, there wasn’t any doorway. More snow had fallen from the clouds in the night and had covered up every one of the little round doorways of Dani Meadow Mouse.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“Ha!” said Dani, “I shall have a busy day, a very busy day, opening all my doorways. I’ll eat my breakfast, and then I’ll go to work.”</p></p>

<p><p>So Dani Meadow Mouse ate a good breakfast of seeds which she had stored in the hollow in the old fence-post buried under the snow, and then she began work on the nearest doorway. It really wasn’t work at all, for you see the snow was soft and light, and Dani dearly loved to dig in it. In a few minutes she had made a wee hole through which she could peep up at jolly, round Mr. Sun. In a few minutes more she had made it big enough to put her head out. She looked this way and she looked that way. Far, far off on the top of a tree she could see old Roughleg the Hawk, but she was so far away that Dani didn’t fear her at all.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“I don’t see anything or anybody to be afraid of,” said Dani and poked her head out a little farther.</p></p>

<p><p>Then she sat and studied everything around her a long, long time. It was a beautiful white world, a very beautiful white world. Everything was so white and pure and beautiful that it didn’t seem possible that harm or danger for anyone could even be thought of. But Dani Meadow Mouse learned long ago that things are not always what they seem, and so she sat with just her little head sticking out of her doorway and studied and studied. Just a little way off was a little heap of snow.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“I don’t remember that,” said Dani. “And I don’t remember anything that would make that. There isn’t any little bush or old log or anything underneath it. Perhaps rough Brother North Wind heaped it up, just for fun.”</p></p>

<p><p>But all the time Dani Meadow Mouse kept studying and studying that little heap of snow. Pretty soon she saw rough Brother North Wind coming her way and tossing the snow about as he came. He caught a handful from the top of the little heap of snow that Dani was studying, and when he had passed, Dani’s sharp eyes saw something red there. It was just the color of the cloak old Granny Fox wears.</p></p>

<p><blockquote>   <p class="q">     “Granny Fox, you can’t fool me!<br>     I see you plain as plain can be!”   </p> </blockquote></p>

<p><p>shouted Dani Meadow Mouse and dropped down out of sight, while old Granny Fox shook the snow from her red cloak and, with a snarl of disappointment and anger, slowly started for the Green Forest, where Reddy Fox was waiting for her.</p></p>

<p></section></p>

<p><section class="chapter-set"></p>

<p><h2 id="ch9"><a href="#ch9"><span>IX</span> Dani Meadow Mouse Is Caught at Last</a></h2></p>

<p><blockquote>   <p class="q">     “Tippy-toppy-tippy-toe,<br>     Play and frolic in the snow!<br>     Now you see me! Now you don’t!<br>     Think you’ll catch me, but you won’t!<br>     Tippy-toppy-tippy-toe,<br>     Oh, such fun to play in snow!”   </p> </blockquote></p>

<p><p>Dani Meadow Mouse sang this, or at least she tried to sing it, as she skipped about on the snow that covered the Green Meadows. But Dani Meadow Mouse has such a little voice, such a funny little squeaky voice, that had you been there you probably would never have guessed that she was singing. She thought she was, though, and was enjoying it just as much as if she had the most beautiful voice in the world. You know singing is nothing in the world but happiness in the heart making itself heard.</p></p>

<p><p>Oh, yes, Dani Meadow Mouse was happy! Why shouldn’t she have been? Hadn’t she proved herself smarter than old Granny Fox? That is something to make anyone happy. Some folks may fool Granny Fox once; some may fool her twice; but there are very few who can keep right on fooling her until she gives up in disgust. That is just what Dani Meadow Mouse had done, and she felt very smart and of course she felt very happy.</p></p>

<p><p>So Dani sang her little song and skipped about in the moonlight, and dodged in and out of her little round doorways, and all the time kept her sharp little eyes open for any sign of Granny Fox or Reddy Fox. But with all her smartness, Dani forgot. Yes, sir, Dani forgot one thing. She forgot to watch up in the sky. She knew that of course old Roughleg the Hawk was asleep, so she had nothing to fear from her. But she never once thought of Hooty the Owl.</p></p>

<p><p>Dear me, dear me! Forgetting is a dreadful habit. If nobody ever forgot, there wouldn’t be nearly so much trouble in the world. No, indeed, there wouldn’t be nearly so much trouble. And Dani Meadow Mouse forgot. She skipped and sang and was happy as could be, and never once thought to watch up in the sky.</p></p>

<p><p>Over in the Green Forest Hooty the Owl had had poor hunting, and he was feeling cross. You see, Hooty was hungry, and hunger is apt to make one feel cross. The longer he hunted, the hungrier and crosser he grew. Suddenly he thought of Dani Meadow Mouse.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“I suppose she is asleep somewhere safe and snug under the snow,” grumbled Hooty, “but she might be, she just <em>might</em> be out for a frolic in the moonlight. I believe I’ll go down on the meadows and see.”</p></p>

<p><p>Now Hooty the Owl can fly without making the teeniest, weeniest sound. It seems as if he just drifts along through the air like a great shadow. Now he spread his great wings and floated out over the meadows. You know Hooty can see as well at night as most folks can by day, and it was not long before he saw Dani Meadow Mouse skipping about on the snow and dodging in and out of her little round doorways. Hooty’s great eyes grew brighter and fiercer. Without a sound he floated through the moonlight until he was just over Dani Meadow Mouse.</p></p>

<p><p>Too late Dani looked up. Her little song ended in a tiny squeak of fear, and she started for her nearest little round doorway. Hooty the Owl reached down with his long cruel claws and — Dani Meadow Mouse was caught at last!</p></p>

<p><h2 id="ch10"><a href="#ch10"><span>X</span> A Strange Ride and How It Ended</a></h2></p>

<p><aside class="illo">   <figure>     <img src="images/dani/hooty.jpg" />     <figcaption>Dani Meadow Mouse was caught at last!</figcaption>   </figure> </aside></p>

<p><p>Dani Meadow Mouse often had sat watching Skimmer the Swallow sailing around up in the blue, blue sky. She had watched Ol’ Mistah Buzzard go up, up, up, until he was nothing but a tiny speck, and Dani had wondered how it would seem to be way up above the Green Meadows and the Green Forest and look down. It had seemed to her that it must be very wonderful and beautiful. Sometimes she had wished that she had wings and could go up in the air and look down. And now here she was, she, Dani Meadow Mouse, actually doing that very thing!</p></p>

<p><p>But Dani could see nothing wonderful or beautiful now. No, indeed! Everything was terrible, for you see Dani Meadow Mouse wasn’t flying herself. She was being carried. Yes, sir, Dani Meadow Mouse was being carried through the air in the cruel claws of Hooty the Owl! And all because Dani had forgotten — forgotten to watch up in the sky for danger.</p></p>

<p><p>Poor, poor Dani Meadow Mouse! Hooty’s great cruel claws hurt her dreadfully! But it wasn’t the pain that was the worst. No, indeed! It wasn’t the pain! It was the thought of what would happen when Hooty reached his home in the Green Forest, for she knew that there Hooty would gobble her up, bones and all. As he flew, Hooty kept chuckling, and Dani Meadow Mouse knew just what those chuckles meant. They meant that Hooty was thinking of the good meal he was going to have.</p></p>

<p><p>Hanging there in Hooty’s great cruel claws, Dani looked down on the snow-covered Green Meadows she loved so well. They seemed a frightfully long way below her, though really they were not far at all, for Hooty was flying very low. But Dani Meadow Mouse had never in all her life been so high up before, and so it seemed to her that she was way, way up in the sky, and she shut her eyes so as not to see. But she couldn’t keep them shut. No, sir, she couldn’t keep them shut! She just <em>had</em> to keep opening them. There was the dear old Green Forest drawing nearer and nearer. It always had looked very beautiful to Dani Meadow Mouse, but now it looked terrible, very terrible indeed, because over in it, hidden away there in some dark place, was the home of Hooty the Owl.</p></p>

<p><p>Just ahead of her was the Old Briar-patch where Peter Rabbit lives so safely. Every old bramble in it was covered with snow and it was very, very beautiful. Really everything was just as beautiful as ever — the moonlight, the Green Forest, the snow-covered Green Meadows, the Old Briar-patch. The only change was in Dani Meadow Mouse herself, and it was all because she had forgotten.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly Dani began to wriggle and struggle. “Keep still!” snapped Hooty the Owl.</p></p>

<p><p>But Dani only struggled harder than ever. It seemed to her that Hooty wasn’t holding her as tightly as at first. She felt one of Hooty’s claws slip. It tore her coat and hurt dreadfully, but it slipped! The fact is, Hooty had only grabbed Dani Meadow Mouse by the loose part of her coat, and up in the air he couldn’t get hold of Dani any better. Dani kicked, squirmed, and twisted, and twisted, squirmed, and kicked. She felt her coat tear and of course the skin with it, but she kept right on, for now she was hanging almost free. Hooty had started down now, so as to get a better hold. Dani gave one more kick and then — she felt herself falling!</p></p>

<p><p>Dani Meadow Mouse shut her eyes and held her breath. Down, down, down she fell. It seemed to her that she never would strike the snow-covered meadows! Really she fell only a very little distance. But it seemed a terrible distance to Dani. She hit something that scratched her, and then plump! She landed in the soft snow right in the very middle of the Old Briar-patch, and the last thing she remembered was hearing the scream of disappointment and rage of Hooty the Owl.</p></p>

<p><h2 id="ch11"><a href="#ch11"><span>XI</span> Peter Rabbit Gets a Fright</a></h2></p>

<p><p>Peter Rabbit sat in his favorite place in the middle of the dear Old Briar-patch, trying to decide which way he would go on his travels that night. The night before he had had a narrow escape from old Granny Fox over in the Green Forest. There was nothing to eat around the Smiling Pool and no one to talk to there any more, and you know that Peter must either eat or ask questions in order to be perfectly happy. No, the Smiling Pool was too dull a place to interest Peter on such a beautiful moonlight night, and Peter had no mind to try his legs against those of old Granny Fox again in the Green Forest.</p></p>

<p><p>Early that morning, just after Peter had settled down for his morning nap, Charlotte Chickadee had dropped into the dear Old Briar-patch just to be neighborly. Peter was just dozing off when he heard the cheeriest little voice in the world. It was saying:</p></p>

<p><blockquote>   <p class="q">     “Dee-dee-chickadee!<br>     I see you! Can you see me?”   </p> </blockquote></p>

<p><p>Peter began to smile even before he could get his eyes open and look up. There, right over her head, was Charlotte hanging head down from a nodding old bramble. In a twinkling she was down on the snow right in front of Peter, then up in the brambles again, right side up, upside down, here, there, everywhere, never still a minute, and all the time chattering away in the cheeriest little voice in the world.</p></p>

<p><blockquote>   <p class="q">     “Dee-dee-chickadee!<br>     I’m as happy as can be!<br>     Find it much the better way<br>     To be happy all the day.<br>     Dee-dee-chickadee!<br>     Everybody’s good to me!&ldquo;   </p> </blockquote></p>

<p><p class="q">“Hello, Charlotte!” said Peter Rabbit. “Where’d you come from?”</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“From Farmer Brown’s new orchard up on the hill. It’s a fine orchard, Peter Rabbit, a fine orchard. I go there every morning for my breakfast. If the winter lasts long enough, I’ll have all the trees cleaned up for Farmer Brown.”</p></p>

<p><p>Peter looked puzzled. “What do you mean?” he asked.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“Just what I say,” replied Charlotte, almost turning a somersault in the air. “There’s a million eggs of insects on those young peach trees, but I’m clearing them all off as fast as I can. They’re mighty fine eating, Peter Rabbit, mighty fine eating!” And with that Charlotte had said good-by and flitted away.</p></p>

<p><p>Peter was thinking of that young orchard now, as he sat in the moonlight trying to make up his mind where to go. The thought of those young peach trees made his mouth water. It was a long way up to the orchard on the hill, a very long way, and Peter was wondering if it really was safe to go. He had just about made up his mind to try it, for Peter is very, very fond of the bark of young peach trees, when <em>thump!</em> something dropped out of the sky at his very feet.</p></p>

<p><p>It startled Peter so that he nearly tumbled over backward. And right at the same instant came the fierce, angry scream of Hooty the Owl. That almost made Peter’s heart stop beating, although he knew that Hooty couldn’t get him down there in the Old Briar-patch. When Peter got his wits together and his heart didn’t go so jumpy, he looked to see what had dropped so close to him out of the sky. His big eyes grew bigger than ever, and he rubbed them to make quite sure that he really saw what he thought she saw. Yes, there was no doubt about it — there at his feet lay Dani Meadow Mouse!</p></p>

<p> <h2 id="ch12"><a href="#ch12"><span>XII</span> The Old Briar-patch Has a New Tenant</a></h2></p>

<p><p>Dani Meadow Mouse slowly opened her eyes and then closed them again quickly, as if afraid to look around. She could hear someone talking. It was a pleasant voice, not at all like the terrible voice of Hooty the Owl, which was the very last thing that Dani Meadow Mouse could remember. Dani lay still a minute and listened.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“Why, Dani Meadow Mouse, where in the world did you drop from?” asked the voice. It sounded like — why, very much like Peter Rabbit speaking. Dani opened her eyes again. It <em>was</em> Peter Rabbit.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“Where — where am I?” asked Dani Meadow Mouse in a very weak and small voice.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“In the middle of the dear Old Briar-patch with me,&rdquo; replied Peter Rabbit. “But how did you get here? You seemed to drop right out of the sky.”</p></p>

<p><p>Dani Meadow Mouse shuddered. Suddenly she remembered everything: how Hooty the Owl had caught her in great cruel claws and had carried her through the moonlight across the snow-covered Green Meadows; how she had felt Hooty’s claws slip and then had struggled and kicked and twisted and turned until her coat had torn and she had dropped down, down, down until she had landed in the soft snow and knocked all the breath out of her little body. The very last thing she could remember was Hooty’s fierce scream of rage and disappointment. Dani shuddered again.</p></p>

<p><p>Then a new thought came to her. She must get out of sight! Hooty might catch her again! Dani tried to scramble to her feet.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“Ouch! Oh!” groaned Dani and lay still again.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“There, there. Keep still, Dani Meadow Mouse. There’s nothing to be afraid of here,” said Peter Rabbit gently. His big eyes filled with tears as he looked at Dani Meadow Mouse, for Dani was all torn and hurt by the cruel claws of Hooty the Owl, and you know Peter has a very tender heart.</p></p>

<p><p>So Dani lay still, and while Peter Rabbit tried to make her comfortable and dress her hurts, she told Peter all about how she had forgotten to watch up in the sky and so had been caught by Hooty the Owl, and all about her terrible ride in Hooty’s cruel claws.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“Oh, dear, whatever shall I do now?” she ended. “However shall I get back home to my warm house of grass, my safe little tunnels under the snow, and my little store of seeds in the snug hollow in the old fence-post?”</p></p>

<p><p>Peter Rabbit looked thoughtful. “You can’t do it,” said he. “You simply can’t do it. It is such a long way for a little fellow like you that it wouldn’t be safe to try. If you went at night, Hooty the Owl might catch you again. If you tried in daylight, old Roughleg the Hawk would be almost sure to see you. And night or day old Granny Fox or Reddy Fox might come snooping around, and if they did, they would be sure to catch you. I tell you what, you stay right here! The dear Old Briar-patch is the safest place in the world. Why, just think, here you can come out in broad daylight and laugh at Granny and Reddy Fox and at old Roughleg the Hawk, because the good old brambles will keep them out, if they try to get you. You can make just as good tunnels under the snow here as you had there, and there are lots and lots of seeds on the ground to eat. You know I don’t care for them myself. I’m lonesome sometimes, living here all alone. You stay here, and we’ll have the Old Briar-patch to ourselves.”</p></p>

<p><p>Dani Meadow Mouse looked at Peter gratefully. “I will, and thank you ever so much, Peter Rabbit,” she said.</p></p>

<p><p>And this is how the dear Old Briar-patch happened to have another tenant.</p></p>

<p></section></p>

<p></p>

<p><section class="chapter-set"></p>

<p><h2 id="ch13"><a href="#ch13"><span>XIII</span> Peter Rabbit Visits the Peach Orchard</a></h2></p>

<p><aside class="illo">   <figure>     <img src="images/dani/peter-trees.jpg" />     <figcaption>Peter Rabbit hurried along through the moonlight.</figcaption>   </figure> </aside></p>

<p> <p class="q">“Don’t go, Peter Rabbit! Don’t go!” begged Dani Meadow Mouse.</p></p>

<p><p>Peter hopped to the edge of the Old Briar-patch and looked over the moonlit, snow-covered meadows to the hill back of Farmer Brown’s house. On that hill was the young peach orchard of which Charlotte Chickadee had told him, and ever since Peter’s mouth had watered and watered every time she thought of those young peach trees and the tender bark on them.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“I think I will, Dani, just this once,” said Peter. “It’s a long way, and I’ve never been there before; but I guess it’s just as safe as the Meadows or the Green Forest.</p></p>

<p><blockquote>   <p class="q">     “Oh I’m as bold as bold can be!<br>     Sing hoppy-hippy-hippy-hop-o!<br>     I’ll hie me forth the world to see!<br>     Sing hoppy-hippy-hippy-hop-o!<br>       My ears are long,<br>       My legs are strong,<br>       So now good day;<br>       I’ll hie away!<br>     Sing hoppy-hippy-hippy-hop-o!”   </p> </blockquote></p>

<p><p>And with that, Peter Rabbit left the dear safe Old Briar-patch, and away he went lipperty-lipperty-lip, across the Green Meadows towards the hill and the young orchard back of Farmer Brown’s house.</p></p>

<p><p>Dani Meadow Mouse watched him go and shook her head in disapproval. “Foolish, foolish, foolish!” she said over and over to herself. “Why can’t Peter be content with the good things that he has?”</p></p>

<p><p>Peter Rabbit hurried along through the moonlight, stopping every few minutes to sit up to look and listen. He heard the fierce hunting call of Hooty the Owl way over in the Green Forest, so he felt sure that at present there was nothing to fear from him. He knew that since their return to the Green Meadows and the Green Forest, Granny and Reddy Fox had kept away from Farmer Brown’s, so he did not worry about them.</p></p>

<p><p>All in good time Peter came to the young orchard. It was just as Charlotte Chickadee had told him. Peter hopped up to the nearest peach tree and nibbled the bark. My, how good it tasted! He went all around the tree, stripping off the bark. He stood up on his long hind legs and reached as high as he could. Then he dug the snow away and ate down as far as he could. When he could get no more tender young bark, he went on to the next tree.</p></p>

<p><p>Now though Peter didn’t know it, he was in the very worst kind of mischief. You see, when he took off all the bark all the way around the young peach tree he killed the tree, for you know it is on the inside of the bark that the sap which gives life to a tree and makes it grow goes up from the roots to all the branches. So when Peter ate the bark all the way around the trunk of the young tree, he had made it impossible for the sap to come up in the spring. Oh, it was the worst kind of mischief that Peter Rabbit was in.</p></p>

<p><p>But Peter didn’t know it, and he kept right on filling that big stomach of his and enjoying it so much that he forgot to watch out for danger. Suddenly, just as he had begun on another tree, a great roar right behind him made him jump almost out of his skin. He knew that voice, and without waiting to even look behind him, he started for the stone wall on the other side of the orchard. Right at his heels, her great mouth wide open, was Bella the Hound.</p></p>

<p> <h2 id="ch14"><a href="#ch14"><span>XIV</span> Farmer Brown Sets a Trap</a></h2></p>

<p><p>Peter Rabbit was in trouble. He had got into mischief and now, like everyone who gets into mischief, he wished that he hadn’t. The worst of it was that he was a long way from his home in the dear Old Briar-patch, and he didn’t know how he ever could get back there again. Where was he? Why, in the stone wall on one side of Farmer Brown’s young peach orchard. How Peter blessed the old stone wall in which he had found a safe hiding-place! Bella had hung around nearly all night, so that Peter had not dared to try to go home. Now it was daylight, and Peter knew it would not be safe to put his nose outside.</p></p>

<p><p>Peter was worried, so worried that he couldn’t go to sleep as he usually does in the daytime. So he sat hidden in the old wall and waited and watched. By and by he saw Farmer Brown and Farmer Brown’s girl come out into the orchard. Right away they saw the mischief which Peter had done, and he could tell by the sound of their voices that they were very, very angry. They went away, but before long they were back again, and all day long Peter watched them work putting something around each of the young peach-trees. Peter grew so curious that he forgot all about his troubles and how far away from home he was. He could hardly wait for night to come so that he might see what they had been doing.</p></p>

<p><p>Just as jolly, round, red Mr. Sun started to go to bed behind the Purple Hills, Farmer Brown and his girl started back to the house. Farmer Brown was smiling now.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“I guess that will fix him!” he said.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“Now what does he mean by that?” thought Peter. “Whom will it fix? Can it be me? I don’t need any fixing.”</p></p>

<p><p>He waited just as long as he could. When all was still, and the moonlight had begun to make shadows of the trees on the snow, Peter very cautiously crept out of his hiding-place. Bella the Hound was nowhere in sight, and everything was as quiet and peaceful as it had been when he first came into the orchard the night before. Peter had fully made up his mind to go straight home as fast as his long legs would take him, but his dreadful curiosity insisted that first he must find out what Farmer Brown and his girl had been doing to the young peach trees.</p></p>

<p><p>So Peter hurried over to the nearest tree. All around the trunk of the tree, from the ground clear up higher than Peter could reach, was wrapped wire netting. Peter couldn’t get so much as a nibble of the delicious bark. He hadn’t intended to take any, for he had meant to go right straight home, but now that he couldn’t get any, he wanted some more than ever — just a bite. Peter looked around. Everything was quiet. He would try the next tree, and then he would go home.</p></p>

<p><p>But the next tree was wrapped with wire. Peter hesitated, looked around, turned to go home, thought of how good that bark had tasted the night before, hesitated again, and then hurried over to the third tree. It was protected just like the others. Then Peter forgot all about going home. He wanted some of that delicious bark, and he ran from one tree to another as fast as he could go.</p></p>

<p><p>At last, way down at the end of the orchard, Peter found a tree that had no wire around it. “They must have forgotten this one!” he thought, and his eyes sparkled. All around on the snow were a lot of little, shiny wires, but Peter didn’t notice them. All he saw was that delicious bark on the young peach tree. He hopped right into the middle of the wires, and then, just as he reached up to take the first bite of bark, he felt something tugging at one of his hind legs.</p></p>

<p> <h2 id="ch15"><a href="#ch15"><span>XV</span> Peter Rabbit Is Caught in a Snare</a></h2></p>

<p><p>When Peter Rabbit, reaching up to nibble the bark of one of Farmer Brown’s young trees, felt something tugging at one of his hind legs, he was so startled that he jumped to get away. Instead of doing this, he fell flat on his face. The thing on his hind leg had tightened and held him fast. A great fear came to Peter Rabbit, and lying there in the snow, he kicked and struggled with all his might. But the more he kicked, the tighter grew that hateful thing on his leg! Finally he grew too tired to kick any more and lay still. The dreadful thing that held him hurt his leg, but it didn’t pull when he lay still.</p></p>

<p><p>When he had grown a little calmer, Peter sat up to examine the thing which held him so fast. It was something like one of the blackberry vines he had sometimes tripped over, only it was bright and shiny, and had no branches or tiny prickers, and one end was fastened to a stake. Peter tried to bite off the shiny thing, but even his great, sharp front teeth couldn’t cut it. Then Peter knew what it was. It was wire! It was a snare which Farmer Brown had set to catch him, and which he had walked right into because he had been so greedy for the bark of the young peach tree that he had not used his eyes to look out for danger.</p></p>

<p><p>Oh, how Peter Rabbit did wish that he had not been so curious to know what Farmer Brown had been doing that day, and that he had gone straight home as he had meant to do, instead of trying to get one more meal of young peach bark! Big tears rolled down Peter’s cheeks. What should he do? What <em>could</em> he do? For a long time Peter sat in the moonlight, trying to think of something to do. At last he thought of the stake to which that hateful wire was fastened. The stake was of wood, and Peter’s teeth would cut wood. Peter’s heart gave a great leap of hope, and he began at once to dig away the snow from around the stake, and then settled himself to gnaw the stake in two.</p></p>

<p><p>Peter had been hard at work on the stake a long time and had it a little more than half cut through, when he heard a loud sniff down at the other end of the orchard. He looked up to see — whom do you think? Why, Bella the Hound! She hadn’t seen Peter yet, but she had already found Peter’s tracks, and it would be but a few minutes before she found Peter himself.</p></p>

<p><p>Poor Peter Rabbit! There wasn’t time to finish cutting off the stake. What could he do? He made a frightened jump just as he had when he first felt the wire tugging at his leg. Just as before, he was thrown flat on his face. He scrambled to his feet and jumped again, only to be thrown just as before. Just then Bella the Hound saw him and opening her mouth sent forth a great roar. Peter made one more frantic jump. Snap! the stake had broken! Peter pitched forward on his head, turned a somersault, and scrambled to his feet. He was free at last! That is, he could run, but after him dragged a piece of the stake.</p></p>

<p><p>How Peter did run! It was hard work, for you know he had to drag that piece of stake after him. But he did it, and just in time he crawled into the old stone wall on one side of the orchard, while Bella the Hound barked her disappointment to the moon.</p></p>

<p> <h2 id="ch16"><a href="#ch16"><span>XVI</span> Peter Rabbit’s Hard Journey</a></h2></p>

<p><p>Peter Rabbit sat in the old stone wall along one side of Farmer Brown’s orchard, waiting for Mrs. Moon to put out her light and leave the world in darkness until jolly, round, red Mr. Sun should kick off his rosy bedclothes and begin his daily climb up in the blue, blue sky. In the winter, Mr. Sun is a late sleeper, and Peter knew that there would be two or three hours after Mrs. Moon put out her light when it would be quite dark. And Peter also knew too that by this time Hooty the Owl would probably have caught his dinner. So would old Granny Fox and Reddy Fox. Bella the Hound would be too sleepy to be on the watch. It would be the very safest time for Peter to try to get to his home in the dear Old Briar-patch.</p></p>

<p><p>So Peter waited and waited. Twice Bella the Hound, who had chased him into the old wall, came over and barked at him and tried to get at him. But the old wall kept Peter safe, and Bella gave it up. And all the time Peter sat waiting he was in great pain. You see that shiny wire was drawn so tight that it cut into his flesh and hurt dreadfully, and to the other end of the wire was fastened a piece of wood, part of the stake to which the snare had been made fast and which Peter had managed to gnaw and break off.</p></p>

<p><p>It was on account of this that Peter was waiting for Mrs. Moon to put out her light. He knew that with that stake dragging after him he would have to go very slowly, and he could not run any more risk of danger than he actually had to. So he waited and waited, and by and by, sure enough, Mrs. Moon put out her light. Peter waited a little longer, listening with all his might. Everything was still. Then Peter crept out of the old stone wall.</p></p>

<p><p>Right away trouble began. The stake dragging at the end of the wire fast to his leg caught among the stones and pulled Peter up short. My, how it did hurt! It made the tears come. But Peter shut his teeth hard, and turning back, he worked until he got the stake free. Then he started on once more, dragging the stake after him.</p></p>

<p><p>Very slowly across the orchard and under the fence on the other side crept Peter Rabbit, his leg so stiff and sore that he could hardly touch it to the snow, and all the time dragging that piece of stake, which seemed to grow heavier and harder to drag every minute. Peter did not dare to go out across the open fields, for fear some danger might happen along, and he would have no place to hide. So he crept along close to the fences where bushes grow, and this made it very, very hard, for the dragging stake was forever catching in the bushes with a yank at the sore leg which brought Peter up short with a squeal of pain.</p></p>

<p><p>This was bad enough, but all the time Peter was filled with a dreadful fear that Hooty the Owl or Granny Fox might just happen along. He had to stop to rest very, very often, and then he would listen and listen. Over and over again he said to himself:</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“Oh, dear, whatever did I go up to the young peach orchard for when I knew I had no business there? Why couldn’t I have been content with all the good things that were mine in the Green Forest and on the Green Meadows? Oh, dear! Oh, dear!”</p></p>

<p><p>Just as jolly, round, red Mr. Sun began to light up the Green Meadows, Peter Rabbit reached the dear Old Briar-patch. Dani Meadow Mouse was sitting on the edge of it anxiously watching for him. Peter crawled up and started to creep in along one of his little private paths. He got in himself, but the dragging stake caught among the brambles, and Peter just fell down in the snow right where he was, too tired and worn out to move.</p></p>

<p><h2 id="ch17"><a href="#ch17"><span>XVII</span> Dani Meadow Mouse Becomes Worried</a></h2></p>

<p><aside class="illo">   <figure>     <img src="images/dani/dani-helps-peter.jpg" />     <figcaption>Dani gnawed the stake which held Peter.</figcaption>   </figure> </aside></p>

<p><p>Dani Meadow Mouse limped around through the dear Old Briar-patch, where she had lived with Peter Rabbit ever since she had squirmed out of the claws of Hooty the Owl and dropped there, right at the feet of Peter Rabbit. Dani limped because she was still lame and sore from Hooty’s terrible claws, but she didn’t let herself think much about that, because she was so thankful to be alive at all. So she limped around in the Old Briar-patch, picking up seed which had fallen on the snow, and sometimes pulling down a few of the red berries which cling all winter to the wild rose bushes. The seeds in these were very nice indeed, and Dani always felt especially good after a meal of them.</p></p>

<p><p>Dani Meadow Mouse had grown very fond of Peter Rabbit, for Peter had been very, very good to her. Dani felt that she never, never could repay all of Peter’s kindness. It had been very good of Peter to offer to share the Old Briar-patch with Dani, because Dani was so far from her own home that it would not be safe for her to try to get back there. But Peter had done more than that. He had taken care of Dani, such good care, during the first few days after Dani’s escape from Hooty the Owl. He had brought good things to eat while Dani was too weak and sore to get things for herself. Oh, Peter had been very good indeed to her!</p></p>

<p><p>But now, as Dani limped around, she was not happy. No, sir, she was not happy. The truth is, Dani Meadow Mouse was worried. It was a different kind of worry from any she had known before. You see, for the first time in her life, Dani was worrying about someone else. She was worrying about Peter Rabbit. Peter had been gone from the Old Briar-patch a whole night and a whole day. He often was gone all night, but never all day too. Dani was sure that something had happened to Peter. She thought of how she had begged Peter not to go up to Farmer Brown’s young peach orchard. She had felt in her bones that it was not safe, that something dreadful would happen to Peter. How Peter had laughed at her and bravely started off! Why hadn’t he come home?</p></p>

<p><p>As she limped around, Dani talked to herself:</p></p>

<p><blockquote>   <p class="q">     “Why cannot people be content<br>     With all the good things that are sent,<br>     And mind their own affairs at home<br>     Instead of going forth to roam?”   </p> </blockquote></p>

<p><p>It was now the second night since Peter Rabbit had gone away. Dani Meadow Mouse couldn’t sleep at all. Round and round through the Old Briar-patch she limped, and finally sat down at the edge of it to wait and watch. At last, just as jolly, round, red Mr. Sun sent his first long rays of light across the Green Meadows, Dani saw something crawling towards the Old Briar-patch. She rubbed her eyes and looked again. It was – no, it couldn’t be – yes, it <em>was</em> Peter Rabbit! But what was the matter with him? Always before Peter had come home lipperty-lipperty-lipperty-lip, but now he was crawling, actually <em>crawling</em>! Dani Meadow Mouse didn’t know what to make of it.</p></p>

<p><p>Nearer and nearer came Peter. Something was following him. No, Peter was dragging something after him. At last Peter started to crawl along one of his little private paths into the Old Briar-patch. The thing dragging behind caught in the brambles, and Peter fell headlong in the snow, too tired and worn out to move. Then Dani saw what the trouble was. A wire was fast to one of Peter’s long hind legs, and to the other end of the wire was fastened part of a stake. Peter had been caught in a snare! Dani hurried over to Peter and tears stood in her eyes.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">”Poor Peter Rabbit! Oh, I’m so sorry, Peter!” she whimpered.</p></p>

<p> <h2 id="ch18"><a href="#ch18"><span>XVIII</span> Dani Meadow Mouse Returns a Kindness</a></h2></p>

<p><p>There Peter Rabbit lay. He had dragged that piece of stake a long way, a very long way, indeed. But now he could drag it no farther, for it had caught in the bramble bushes. So Peter just dropped on the snow and cried. Yes, sir, he cried! You see he was so tired and worn out and frightened, and his leg was so stiff and sore and hurt him so! And then it was so dreadful to actually get home and be stopped right on your very own doorstep. So Peter just lay there and cried. Just supposing old Granny Fox should come poking around and find Peter caught that way! All she would have to do would be to get hold of that hateful stake caught in the bramble bushes and pull Peter out where she could get him. Do you wonder that Peter cried?</p></p>

<p><p>By and by he became aware that someone was wiping away his tears. It was Dani Meadow Mouse. And Dani was singing in a funny little voice. Pretty soon Peter stopped crying and listened, and this is what he heard:</p></p>

<p><blockquote>   <p class="q">     “Isn’t any use to cry!<br>     Not a bit! Not a bit!<br>     Wipe your eyes and wipe ’em dry!<br>     Use your wit! Use your wit!<br>     Just remember that tomorrow<br>     Never brings a single sorrow.<br>     Yesterday has gone forever<br>     And tomorrow gets here never.<br>     Chase your worries all away;<br>     Nothing’s worse than just to-day.”   </p> </blockquote></p>

<p><p>Peter smiled in spite of himself.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">&ldquo;That’s right! That’s right! Smile away, Peter Rabbit. Smile away! Your troubles, sir, are all to-day. And between you and me, I don’t believe they are so bad as you think they are. Now you lie still just where you are, while I go see what can be done.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>With that off whisked Dani Meadow Mouse as spry as you please, in spite of her lame leg, and in a few minutes Peter knew by little twitches of the wire on his leg that Dani was doing something at the other end. She was. Dani Meadow Mouse had set out to gnaw that piece of stake all to splinters. So there she sat and gnawed and gnawed and gnawed. Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun climbed higher and higher in the sky, and Dani Meadow Mouse grew hungry, but still she kept right on gnawing at that bothersome stake.</p></p>

<p><p>By and by, happening to look across the snow-covered Green Meadows, she saw something that made her heart jump. It was Farmer Brown’s girl coming straight over towards the dear Old Briar-patch.</p></p>

<p><p>Dani didn’t say a word to Peter Rabbit, but gnawed faster than ever.</p></p>

<p><p>Farmer Brown’s girl was almost there when Dani stopped gnawing. There was only a tiny bit of the stake left now, and Dani hurried to tell Peter Rabbit that there was nothing to stop him now from going to his most secret retreat in the very heart of the Old Briar-patch. While Peter slowly dragged his way along, Dani trotted behind to see that the wire did not catch on the bushes.</p></p>

<p><p>They had safely reached Peter Rabbit’s secretest retreat when Farmer Brown’s girl came up to the edge of the dear Old Briar-patch.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">&ldquo;So this is where that rabbit that killed our peach tree lives!&rdquo; said she. “We’ll try a few snares and put you out of mischief.&ldquo;</p></p>

<p><p>And for the rest of the afternoon Farmer Brown’s girl was very busy around the edge of the Old Briar-patch.</p></p>

<p> <h2 id="ch19"><a href="#ch19"><span>XIX</span> Peter Rabbit and Dani Meadow Mouse Live High</a></h2></p>

<p><p>Peter Rabbit sat in his secretest place in the dear Old Briar-patch with one of his long hind legs all swelled up and terribly sore because of the fine wire fast around it and cutting into it. He could hear Farmer Brown’s girl going around on the edge of the dear Old Briar-patch and stopping every little while to do something. In spite of his pain, Peter was curious. Finally he called Dani Meadow Mouse.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">&quot;Dani, you are small and can keep out of sight easier than I can. Go as near as ever you dare to Farmer Brown’s girl and find out what she is doing,&rdquo; said Peter Rabbit.</p></p>

<p><p>So Dani Meadow Mouse crept out as near to Farmer Brown’s girl as ever she dared and studied and studied to make out what Farmer Brown’s girl was doing. By and by she returned to Peter Rabbit.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">&ldquo;I don’t know what she’s doing, Peter, but he’s putting something in every one of your private little paths leading into the Briar-patch from the Green Meadows.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p class="q">&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Peter Rabbit.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">&ldquo;There are little loops of that strange stuff you’ve got hanging to your leg, Peter,&rdquo; continued Dani Meadow Mouse.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">&ldquo;Just so!&rdquo; said Peter Rabbit.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">&ldquo;And he’s put cabbage leaves and pieces of apple all around,&rdquo; said Dani.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">&ldquo;We must be careful!&rdquo; said Peter Rabbit.</p></p>

<p><p>Peter’s leg was in a very bad way, indeed, and Peter suffered a great deal of pain. The worst of it was, he didn’t know how to get off the wire that was cutting into it so. He had tried to cut the wire with his big teeth, but he couldn’t do it. Dani Meadow Mouse had tried and tried to gnaw the wire, but it wasn’t the least bit of use. But Dani wasn’t easily discouraged, and she kept working and working at it. Once she thought she felt it slip a little. She said nothing, but kept right on working. Pretty soon she was sure that it slipped. She went right on working harder than ever. By and by she had it so loose that she slipped it right off of Peter’s leg, and Peter didn’t know anything about it. You see, that cruel wire snare had been so tight that Peter didn’t have any feeling except of pain left in his leg, and so when Dani Meadow Mouse pulled the cruel wire snare off, Peter didn’t know it until Dani held it up in front of him.</p></p>

<p><p>My, how thankful Peter was, and how he did thank Dani Meadow Mouse! But Dani said that it was nothing at all, just nothing at all, and that she owed more than that to Peter Rabbit for being so good to her and letting her live in the dear Old Briar-patch.</p></p>

<p><p>It was a long time before Peter could hop as he used to, but after the first day he managed to get around. He found that Farmer Brown’s girl had spread those miserable wire snares in every one of her private little paths. But Peter knew what they were now. He showed Dani Meadow Mouse how she, because she was so small, could safely run about among the snares and steal all the cabbage leaves and apples which Farmer Brown’s girl had put there for bait.</p></p>

<p><p>Dani Meadow Mouse thought this great fun and a great joke on Farmer Brown’s girl. So every day she stole the bait, and she and Peter Rabbit lived high while Peter’s leg was getting well. And all the time Farmer Brown’s girl wondered why she couldn’t catch Peter Rabbit.</p></p>

<p><h2 id="ch20"><a href="#ch20"><span>XX</span> Timid Dani Meadow Mouse</a></h2></p>

<p><p>Dani Meadow Mouse is timid. Everybody says so, and what everybody says ought to be so. But just as anybody can make a mistake sometimes, so can everybody. Still, in this case, it is quite likely that everybody is right. Dani Meadow Mouse <em>is</em> timid. Ask Peter Rabbit. Ask Sammy Jay. Ask Striped Chipmunk. They will all tell you the same thing. Sammy Jay might even tell you that Dani is afraid of her own shadow, or that she tries to run away from her own tail. Of course this isn’t true. Sammy Jay likes to say mean things. It isn’t fair to Dani Meadow Mouse to believe what Sammy Jay says.</p></p>

<p><p>But the fact is Dani certainly is timid. More than this, she isn’t ashamed of it — not the least little bit.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">&ldquo;You see, it’s this way,&rdquo; said Dani, as she sat on her doorstep one sunny morning talking to her friend, old Mrs. Toad. “If I weren’t afraid, I wouldn’t be all the time watching out, and if I weren’t all the time watching out, I wouldn’t have any more chance than that foolish red ant running across in front of you.”</p></p>

<p><p>Old Mrs. Toad looked where Dani was pointing, and her tongue darted out and back again so quickly that Dani wasn’t sure that she saw it at all, but when she looked for the ant it was nowhere to be seen, and there was a satisfied twinkle in Mrs. Toad’s eyes. There was an answering twinkle in Dani’s own eyes as she continued.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said she, “I wouldn’t stand a particle more chance than that foolish ant did. Now if I were big and strong, like Old Man Coyote, or had swift wings, like Skimmer the Swallow, or were so homely and ugly-looking that no one wanted me, like—like—&quot; Dani hesitated and then finished rather lamely, “like some folks I know, I suppose I wouldn’t be afraid.&ldquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Old Mrs. Toad looked up sharply when Dani mentioned homely and ugly-looking people, but Dani was gazing far out across the Green Meadows and looked so innocent that Mrs. Toad concluded that she couldn’t have had her in mind.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">&quot;Well,&rdquo; said she, thoughtfully scratching her nose, “I suppose you may be right, but for my part fear seems a very foolish thing. Now, I don’t know what it is. I mind my own business, and no one ever bothers me. I should think it would be a very uncomfortable feeling.&ldquo;</p></p>

<p><p class="q">&quot;It is,&rdquo; replied Dani, “but, as I said before, it is a very good thing to keep one on guard when there are as many watching for one as there are for me. Now there’s Mr. Blacksnake and—&quot;</p></p>

<p><p class="q">&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; exclaimed old Mrs. Toad, turning as pale as a toad can turn, and looking uneasily and anxiously in every direction.</p></p>

<p><p>Dani turned her head to hide a smile. If old Mrs. Toad wasn’t showing fear, no one ever did. “Oh,&ldquo; said she, “I didn’t mean that he is anywhere around here now. What I was going to say was that there is Mr. Blacksnake and Granny Fox and Reddy Fox and Redtail the Hawk and Hooty the Owl and others I might name, always watching for a chance to make a dinner from poor little me. Do you wonder that I am afraid most of the time?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p class="q">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied old Mrs. Toad. “No, I don’t wonder that you are afraid. It must be dreadful to feel hungry eyes are watching for you every minute of the day and night, too.&ldquo;</p></p>

<p><p class="q">&quot;Oh, it’s not so bad,&rdquo; replied Dani. “It’s rather exciting. Besides, it keeps my wits sharp all the time. I am afraid I should find life very dull indeed if, like you, I feared nothing and nobody. By the way, see how that grass is moving over there. It looks as if Mr. Blacksnake— Why, Mrs. Toad, where are you going in such a hurry?&ldquo;</p></p>

<p><p class="q">&quot;I’ve just remembered an important engagement with my cousin, Grandfather Frog, at the Smiling Pool,&rdquo; shouted old Mrs. Toad over her shoulder, as she hurried so that she fell over her own feet.</p></p>

<p><p>Dani chuckled as she sat alone on her doorstep. “Oh, no, old Mrs. Toad doesn’t know what fear is!&ldquo; said he. “Funny how some people won’t admit what everybody can see for themselves. Now, I <em>am</em> afraid, and I’m willing to say so.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><h2 id="ch21"><a href="#ch21"><span>XXI</span> An Exciting Day for Dani Meadow Mouse</a></h2></p>

<p><p>Dani Meadow Mouse started along one of her private little paths very early one morning. she was on her way to get a supply of a certain kind of grass seed of which she is very fond. She had been thinking about that seed for some time and waiting for it to get ripe. Now it was just right, as she had found out the day before by a visit to the place where this particular grass grew. The only trouble was it grew a long way from Dani’s home, and to reach it she had to cross an open place where the grass was so short that she couldn’t make a path under it.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">&ldquo;I feel it in my bones that this is going to be an exciting day,&rdquo; said Dani to herself as she trotted along. “I suppose that if I were really wise, I would stay nearer home and do without that nice seed. But nothing is really worth having unless it is worth working for, and that seed will taste all the better if I have hard work getting it.&ldquo;</p></p>

<p><p>So she trotted along her private little path, her ears wide open, and her eyes wide open, and her little nose carefully testing every Merry Little Breeze who happened along for any scent of danger which it might carry. Most of all she depended upon her ears, for the grass was so tall that she couldn’t see over it, even when she sat up. She had gone only a little way when she thought she heard a quiet rustling behind her. She stopped to listen. There it was again, and it certainly was right in the path behind her! She didn’t need to be told who was making it. There was only one who could make such a sound as that — Mr. Blacksnake.</p></p>

<p> <p>Now Dani can run very fast along her private little paths, but she knew that Mr. Blacksnake could run faster. “If my legs can’t save me, my wits must,&rdquo; thought Dani as she started to run as fast as ever she could. “I must reach that fallen old hollow fence-post.&ldquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She was almost out of breath when she reached the post and scurried into the open end. She knew by the sound of the rustling that Mr. Blacksnake was right at her heels. Now the old post was hollow its whole length, but halfway there was an old knot-hole just big enough for Dani to squeeze through. Mr. Blacksnake didn’t know anything about that hole; and because it was dark inside the old post, he didn’t see Dani pop through it. Dani ran back along the top of the log and was just in time to see the tip of Mr. Blacksnake’s tail disappear inside. Then what do you think Dani did? Why, she followed Mr. Blacksnake right into the old post, but in doing it she didn’t make the least little bit of noise.</p></p>

<p><p>Mr. Blacksnake kept right on through the old post and out the other end, for he was sure that that was the way Dani had gone. He kept right on along the little path. Now Dani knew that he wouldn’t go very far before he found out that he had been fooled, and of course he would come back. So Dani waited only long enough to get her breath and then ran back along the path to where another little path branched off. For just a minute she paused.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">&quot;If Mr. Blacksnake follows me, he will be sure to think that of course I have taken this other little path,&rdquo; thought Dani, “so I won’t do it.&ldquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Then she ran harder than ever, until she came to a place where two little paths branched off, one to the right and one to the left. She took the latter and scampered on, sure that by this time Mr. Blacksnake would be so badly fooled that he would give up the chase. And Dani was right.</p></p>

<p><blockquote>   <p class="q">     “Brains are better far than speed<br>     As wise folks long ago agreed,&rdquo;   </p> </blockquote></p>

<p><p>said Dani, as she trotted on her way for the grass seed she liked so well. “I felt it in my bones that this would be an exciting day. I wonder what next.&ldquo;</p></p>

<p></section></p>

<p><section class="chapter-set"></p>

<p><h2 id="ch22"><a href="#ch22"><span>XXII</span> What Happened Next to Dani Meadow Mouse</a></h2></p>

<p><aside class="illo">   <figure>     <img src="images/dani/reddy-can.jpg" />     <figcaption>Redtail the Hawk screamed with rage as Dani escaped.</figcaption>   </figure> </aside></p>

<p><p>Dani is so used to narrow escapes that she doesn’t waste any time thinking about them. She didn’t this time. “He who tries to look two ways at once is pretty sure to see nothing,&rdquo; says Dani, and she knew that if she thought too much about the things that had already happened, she couldn’t keep a sharp watch for the things that might happen.</p></p>

<p><p>Nothing more happened as she hurried along her private little path to the edge of a great patch of grass so short that she couldn’t hide under it. She had to cross this, and all the way she would be in plain sight of anyone who happened to be near. Very cautiously she peeped out and looked this way and looked that way, not forgetting to look up in the sky. She could see no one anywhere. Drawing a long breath, Dani started across the open place as fast as her short legs could take her.</p></p>

<p><p>Now all the time, Redtail the Hawk had been sitting in a tree some distance away, sitting so still that she looked like a part of the tree itself. That is why Dani hadn’t seen her. But Redtail saw Dani the instant she started across the open place, for Redtail’s eyes are very keen, and she can see a great distance. With a satisfied chuckle, she spread her broad wings and started after Dani.</p></p>

<p><p>Just about halfway to the safety of the long grass on the other side, Dani gave a hurried look behind her, and her heart seemed to jump right into her mouth, for there was Redtail with her cruel claws already set to seize her! Dani gave a frightened squeak, for she thought that surely this time she would be caught. But she didn’t mean to give up without trying to escape. Three jumps ahead of her was a queer-looking thing. she didn’t know what it was, but if there was a hole in it she might yet fool Redtail.</p></p>

<p><p>One jump! Would she be able to reach it? Two jumps! There <em>was</em> a hole in it! Three jumps! With another frightened squeak, Dani dived into the opening just in time. And what do you think she was in? Why, an old tomato can Farmer Brown’s girl had once used to carry bait in when she went fishing at the Smiling Pool. She had dropped it there on her way home.</p></p>

<p><p>Redtail screamed with rage and disappointment as she struck the old can with her great claws. She had been sure, very sure of Dani Meadow Mouse this time! She tried to pick the can up, but she couldn’t get hold of it. It just rolled away from her every time, try as she would. Finally, in disgust, she gave up and flew back to the tree from which she had first seen Dani.</p></p>

<p><p>Of course Dani had been terribly frightened when the can rolled, and by the noise the claws of Redtail made when they struck her strange hiding-place. But she wisely decided that the best thing she could do was to stay there for a while. And it was very fortunate that she did so, as she was very soon to find out.</p></p>

<p> <h2 id="ch23"><a href="#ch23"><span>XXIII</span> Reddy Fox Grows Curious</a></h2></p>

<p><p>Dani Meadow Mouse had sat perfectly still for a long time inside the old tomato can in which she had found a refuge from Redtail the Hawk. She didn’t dare so much as put her head out for a look around, lest Redtail should be circling overhead ready to pounce on her.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">&ldquo;If I stay here long enough, she’ll get tired and go away, if she hasn’t already,&rdquo; thought Dani. “This has been a pretty exciting morning so far, and I find that I am a little tired. I may as well take a nap while I am waiting to make sure that the way is clear.&ldquo;</p></p>

<p><p>With that Dani curled up in the old tomato can. But it wasn’t meant that Dani should have that nap. She had closed her eyes, but her ears were still open, and presently she heard soft footsteps drawing near. Her eyes flew open, and she forgot all about sleep, you may be sure, for those footsteps sounded familiar. They sounded to Dani very, very much like the footsteps of — whom do you think? Why, Reddy Fox! Dani’s heart began to beat faster as she listened. Could it be? She didn’t dare peep out. Presently a little whiff of scent blew into the old tomato can. Then Dani knew — it <em>was</em> Reddy Fox.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">&quot;Oh, dear! I hope he doesn’t find that I am in here!&rdquo; thought Dani. &ldquo;I wonder what under the sun has brought him up here just now.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>If the truth were to be known, it was curiosity that had brought Reddy up there. Reddy had been hunting for his breakfast some distance away on the Green Meadows when Redtail the Hawk had tried so hard to catch Dani Meadow Mouse. Reddy’s sharp eyes had seen Redtail the minute she left the tree in pursuit of Dani, and he had known by the way Redtail flew that she saw something she wanted to catch. He had watched Redtail swoop down and had heard her scream of rage when she missed Dani because Dani had dodged into the old tomato can. He had seen Redtail strike and strike again at something on the ground, and finally fly off in disgust with empty claws.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">&ldquo;Now, I wonder what it was Redtail was after and why she didn’t get it,&rdquo; thought Reddy. “She acts terribly put out and disappointed. I believe I’ll go over there and find out.&ldquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Off he started at a smart trot towards the patch of short grass where he had seen Redtail the Hawk striking at something on the ground. As he drew near, he crept very softly until he reached the very edge of the open patch. There he stopped and looked sharply all over it. There was nothing to be seen but an old tomato can. Reddy had seen it many times before.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">&quot;Now what under the sun could Redtail have been after here?&rdquo; thought Reddy. “The grass isn’t long enough for a grasshopper to hide in, and yet Redtail didn’t get what she was after. It’s very strange. It certainly is very strange.&ldquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He trotted out and began to run back and forth with his nose to the ground, hoping that his nose would tell him what his eyes couldn’t. Back and forth, back and forth he ran, and then suddenly he stopped.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">&quot;Ha!&rdquo; exclaimed Reddy. He had found the scent left by Dani Meadow Mouse when she ran across towards the old tomato can. Right up to the old can Reddy’s nose led him. He hopped over the old can, but on the other side he could find no scent of Dani Meadow Mouse. In a flash he understood, and a gleam of satisfaction shone in his yellow eyes as he turned back to the old can. He knew that Dani must be hiding in there.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">&ldquo;I’ve got you this time!&rdquo; he snarled, as he sniffed at the opening in the end of the can.</p></p>

<p></p>

<p><h2 id="ch24"><a href="#ch24"><span>XXIV</span> Reddy Fox Loses His Temper</a></h2></p>

<p><p>Reddy Fox had caught Dani Meadow Mouse, and yet he hadn’t caught her. He had found Dani hiding in the old tomato can, and it didn’t enter Reddy’s head that he couldn’t get Dani out when he wanted to. He was in no hurry. He had had a pretty good breakfast of grasshoppers, and so he thought he would torment Dani a while before gobbling her up. He lay down so that he could peep in at the open end of the old can and see Dani trying to make herself as small as possible at the other end. Reddy grinned until he showed all his long teeth. Reddy always is a bully, especially when his victim is a great deal smaller and weaker than himself.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">&ldquo;I’ve got you this time, Ms. Smarty, haven’t I?&rdquo; taunted Reddy.</p></p>

<p><p>Dani didn’t say anything.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">&ldquo;You think you’ve been very clever because you have fooled me two or three times, don’t you? Well, this time I’ve got you where your tricks won’t work,&rdquo; continued Reddy, “so what are you going to do about it?&ldquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Dani didn’t answer. The fact is, she was too frightened to answer. Besides, she didn’t know what she could do. So she just kept still, but her bright eyes never once left Reddy’s cruel face. For all her fright, Dani was doing some hard thinking. She had been in tight places before and had learned never to give up hope. Something might happen to frighten Reddy away. Anyway, Reddy had to get her out of that old can before she would admit that she was really caught.</p></p>

<p><p>For a long time Reddy lay there licking his chops and saying all the things he could think of to frighten poor Dani Meadow Mouse. At last he grew tired of this and made up his mind that it was time to end it and Dani Meadow Mouse at the same time. He thrust his sharp nose in at the opening in the end of the old can, but the opening was too small for him to get more than his nose in, and he only scratched it on the sharp edges without so much as touching Dani.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“I’ll pull you out,” said Reddy and thrust in one black paw.</p></p>

<p><p>Dani promptly bit it so hard that Reddy yelped with pain and pulled it out in a hurry. Presently he tried again with the other paw. Dani bit this one harder still, and Reddy danced with pain and anger. Then he lost his temper completely, a very foolish thing to do, as it always is. He hit the old can, and away it rolled with Dani Meadow Mouse inside. This seemed to make Reddy angrier than ever. He sprang after it and hit it again. Then he batted it first this way and then that way, growing angrier and angrier. And all the time Dani Meadow Mouse managed to keep inside, although she got a terrible shaking up.</p></p>

<p><p>Back and forth across the patch of short grass Reddy knocked the old can, and he was in such a rage that he didn’t notice where he was knocking it to. Finally he sent it spinning into the long grass on the far side of the open patch, close to one of Dani’s private little paths. Like a flash Dani was out and scurrying along the little path. She dodged into another and presently into a third, which brought her to a tangle of barbed wire left there by Farmer Brown when he had built a new fence. Under this she was safe.</p></p>

<p><p class="q">“Phew!” exclaimed Dani, breathing very hard. “That was the narrowest escape yet! But I guess I’ll get that special grass seed I started out for, after all.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>And she did, while to this day Reddy Fox wonders how Dani got out of the old tomato can without his knowing it.</p></p>

<p><blockquote>   <p class="q">     “And so you see what temper does<br>     For those who give it rein;<br>     It cheats them of the very thing<br>     They seek so hard to gain.”   </p> </blockquote></p>
