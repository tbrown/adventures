  </aside>

  <p>Dani Meadow Mouse sat on her doorstep with her chin in her hands. She had only a nod for Jenny Skunk. Even Peter Rabbit could get no more than a grumpy "Good morning." The fact is, Dani Meadow Mouse was worried.</p>

  <p>Striped Chipmunk had called her "Cross Patch" that morning. Johnny Chuck had called her "Grumpy." And what was the matter? Dani was worrying because her tail was short. Yes, that is all that bothered her that bright morning.</p>

  <p>Dani never had noticed how short her tail was until she met her cousin Whitefoot. He lived in the Green Forest. The most striking thing about him was his long, slim, beautiful tail. Right away Dani became aware of her own stubby little tail. She began to wish she had a long tail like Whitefoot.</p>

  <p>She was so busy wishing for a long tail that she forgot to watch for danger. Old Whitetail the Marsh Hawk came sailing over so softly that he almost caught her. If it hadn't been for one of the Merry Little Breezes, Dani would have been caught. And all because she was jealous. It's a bad, bad habit.</p>


  <h2 id="ch2"><a href="#ch2"><span>II</span> Dani Meadow Mouse and Her Short Tail</a></h2>

  <p>All Dani could think about was her short tail. She was so ashamed of it that whenever anyone passed, she hid. Instead of playing in the sunshine, she sat and sulked. Pretty soon her friends began to pass without stopping.</p>

  <p>Finally one day Old Mrs. Toad sat down in front of Dani. "What's the matter?" she asked.</p>

  <p class="q">"Nothing," said Dani.</p>

  <p class="q">"Sun is just as bright as ever, isn't it? Got plenty to eat and drink? Good clothes to wear?" Mrs. Toad looked Dani over. "You must not know when you're well off."</p>

  <p>Dani hung her head. Finally she looked up. "Mrs. Toad, how can I get a long tail like my cousin Whitefoot?"</p>

  <p class="q">"So that's what's the matter! Ha! ha! ha!" said Mrs. Toad. "What good would a long tail do you?"</p>

  <p class="q">"I'd look so much better," said Dani.</p>

  <p>Old Mrs. Toad laughed. "You never saw a Meadow Mouse with a long tail, did you? What a sight it would be! You need to be slim and trim to carry a long tail well. And what a bother! You'd always have to take care to keep it out of harm's way." She paused. "Look at me. I'm homely. But no one tries to catch me like they do Billy Mink for his fine coat. I am happy to be just as I am. You should be too."</p>

  <p class="q">"Perhaps you are right," said Dani. "I'll try."</p>


  <h2 id="ch3"><a href="#ch3"><span>III</span> Dani Meadow Mouse Plays Hide and Seek</a></h2>

  <p>Life is always a game of hide and seek for Dani Meadow Mouse. She is such a fat little thing that many would gobble her up if they could. Peter Rabbit and Jenny Skunk and Striped Chipmunk are friends she can trust. But she always watches for Reddy Fox and Billy Mink and Shadow the Weasel and old Whitetail the Marsh Hawk. She especially watches for Hooty the Owl at night.</p>

  <p>When Brother North Wind shook out the snowflakes until they covered the Green Meadows deep, deep, deep, Dani snuggled down in her snug little house of grass. Dani liked the snow. She loved to dig tunnels in it. Through those tunnels she could go where she pleased without being seen. Every little way she made a round doorway up beside a stiff stalk of grass. Out of this she could peep at the white world.</p>

  <p>Reddy Fox knew all about those doorways. He was hungry most of the time this cold weather. One morning he spied Dani's head popping out of a doorway. Reddy crept forward and got ready to spring. But Dani had disappeared! Reddy jumped anyway and began to dig. All the time Dani was hurrying along one of her tunnels. When Reddy stopped digging, Dani popped her head out of another doorway and laughed at him.</p>

  <p>After a while Reddy tried another plan. He stretched out and pretended to be asleep. Dani watched for a long time, then dropped out of sight. Reddy crept over to the doorway and waited. "She'll stick her head out again to see if I'm asleep," said Reddy. So he waited and waited. By and by he turned his head. There was Dani at another doorway, laughing at him!</p>

<h2 id="ch4"><a href="#ch4"><span>IV</span> Old Granny Fox Tries for Dani Meadow Mouse</a></h2>

    <figcaption>Plunge! Granny Fox tries to catch Dani.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</aside>

<p>Dani giggled all afternoon thinking about that game of hide and seek. Reddy had been "it" all the time, for never once had he caught Dani. Finally Reddy had given up in disgust and gone off to find something else for dinner. In her funny little squeaky voice Dani shouted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="q">
    "Though Reddy Fox is smart and sly,<br>
    Hi-hum-diddle-de-o!<br>
    I'm just as smart and twice as spry.<br>
    Hi-hum-diddle-de-o!"
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That night Reddy told old Granny Fox about Dani. When Reddy told how fat Dani was, Granny's mouth watered.</p>

<p class="q">"I'll go with you tomorrow morning," said Granny. "Then we'll see if Dani Meadow Mouse is as smart as she thinks she is."</p>

<p>Bright and early the next morning, both foxes went down to the meadows. Dani saw them coming. When she saw old Granny Fox, her heart beat faster. She knew that Granny is very smart and has learned most of the tricks of all the meadow and forest people.</p>

<p>Granny set Reddy to hunting for Dani's doorways. As fast as she found them, Granny sniffed at each. She could tell by the smell which one Dani had used last. Finally she came straight towards the tall bunch of grass where Dani was hiding. Dani ducked down and hurried along a tunnel. She heard Granny sniff at the doorway she had just left. Suddenly something plunged down through the snow right at her heels. Dani squeaked with fright. It was Granny Fox herself!</p>


<h2 id="ch5"><a href="#ch5"><span>V</span> What Happened on the Green Meadows</a></h2>

<p>Things were happening fast to Dani down on the snow-covered meadows. Granny Fox wasn't so easily fooled as Reddy. And now Dani had two foxes to watch for. She got so many frights that it seemed as if her heart had jumped right up into her mouth.</p>

<p>Down in her tunnels, Dani felt safe from Reddy, who would just dig at the doorways. But Granny knew about those tunnels. She tilted her sharp ears and listened. She heard Dani running along a tunnel under the snow.</p>

<p><em>Plunge!</em> Granny dived right into the snow and through into Dani's tunnel. Her paws actually touched Dani's tail. Dani was glad then that it was short!</p>

<p class="q">"Ha! I almost got her!" cried Granny. She ran ahead and listened again. <em>Plunge!</em> She just missed again.</p>

<p>Reddy watched and learned. He began plunging too. Now Dani had two foxes diving at her from above. Poor Dani! She didn't know which way to turn. So she sat still. This was the best thing she could do. When she sat still, she made no noise, and the foxes couldn't tell where she was.</p>

<p class="q">"Pooh!" said Granny after a while. "I'll give her a scare."</p>

<p>She began plunging this way and that. Sure enough, she landed so close to Dani that one of her claws scratched her.</p>


<h2 id="ch6"><a href="#ch6"><span>VI</span> Dani Meadow Mouse Remembers and Reddy Fox Forgets</a></h2>

<p class="q">"There she goes!" cried Granny. "Don't let her sit still again!"</p>

<p>They took turns diving into the snow. Down in her tunnels, Dani was running for her life. She was getting tired and almost out of breath. One leg smarted where Granny's claws had scratched her.</p>

<p class="q">"If only I had time to think!" panted Dani. Then Reddy crashed down right at her heels. "I've got to get somewhere safe!" And right then she remembered the old fence-post!</p>

<p>The old fence-post lay on the ground and was hollow. Fastened to it were long wires with sharp barbs. In that hollow Dani had a secret store of seeds. She dodged into the tunnel that led to the fence-post, running faster than ever. Though her heart was full of fear, it was also full of hope.</p>

<p>Old Granny Fox knew about that fence-post and those barbed wires. Just before she reached them, she stopped plunging. Reddy knew about those wires too, but he was so excited that he forgot.</p>

<p class="q">"Stop!" cried Granny sharply.</p>

<p>But Reddy didn't listen. She plunged down as hard as she could.</p>

<p class="q">"Oh! Oh! Ow! Ow!"</p>

<p>That wasn't Dani. It was Reddy Fox. He had landed with his paw right on a sharp wire barb.</p>

<p class="q">"It serves you right for forgetting!" snapped Granny as Reddy hobbled behind her on three legs.</p>

<p>And safe in the hollow of the old fence-post, Dani was fixing the scratch on her leg.</p>

<h2 id="ch7"><a href="#ch7"><span>VII</span> Old Granny Fox Tries a New Plan</a></h2>

</aside>

<p>Old Granny Fox kept thinking about Dani. She knew Dani was fat, and it made her mouth water. She also knew Dani wouldn't go far from the old fence-post now.</p>

<p class="q">"Dani won't put her nose out for a day or two," Granny said to herself. "Then she'll get tired of staying inside. She'll peep out to see if the way is clear. If nothing frightens her, she'll go a little farther each day. I must see to it that she isn't frightened for a few days."</p>

<p>She told Reddy not to go down on the meadows. Reddy grumbled, but he had a sore foot from the wire barb. He had to run on three legs. So he didn't dare disobey.</p>

<p>It all came out just as Granny had planned. Dani <em>did</em> get tired of staying inside. She <em>did</em> peep out first, then run a little way on the snow, then a little farther each day.</p>

<p>Hidden on the edge of the Green Forest, Granny watched. She looked up at the sky. It was going to snow again. "Good," she said. "Tomorrow morning I'll have fat Meadow Mouse for breakfast."</p>

<p>Before Mr. Sun was up the next morning, Granny trotted to where the fence-post lay buried. New snow had covered all of Dani's doorways. Granny stretched out flat. She told Reddy to cover her with snow. Then she sent Reddy off to the forest to wait. She chuckled to think how smart she was.</p>


<h2 id="ch8"><a href="#ch8"><span>VIII</span> Brother North Wind Proves a Friend</a></h2>

<p>Dani had seen nothing of the foxes for several days. Every morning she peeped out of a different doorway to look for danger. She was too wise to forget about them.</p>

<p>One morning she found all her doorways closed. New snow had covered them up.</p>

<p class="q">"I shall have a busy day opening my doorways," said Dani. "I'll eat breakfast first."</p>

<p>After breakfast she dug through the soft snow until she could peep up at Mr. Sun. She looked this way and that way. Far off she could see Roughleg the Hawk, but she was too far away to fear. Just a little way off was a little heap of snow.</p>

<p class="q">"I don't remember that," said Dani. "There's no bush or log under it. Perhaps Brother North Wind heaped it up for fun."</p>

<p>But she kept studying that heap of snow. Pretty soon Brother North Wind came along, tossing snow about. He caught a handful from the top of that heap. When he passed, Dani's sharp eyes saw something red. It was the color of old Granny Fox's coat!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="q">
    "Granny Fox, you can't fool me!<br>
    I see you plain as plain can be!"
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>shouted Dani, and dropped out of sight. Granny shook off the snow and slowly started for the forest, snarling with disappointment.</p>

</section>

<section class="chapter-set">

<h2 id="ch9"><a href="#ch9"><span>IX</span> Dani Meadow Mouse Is Caught at Last</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p class="q">
    "Tippy-toppy-tippy-toe,<br>
    Play and frolic in the snow!<br>
    Now you see me! Now you don't!<br>
    Think you'll catch me, but you won't!"
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dani sang as she skipped about in the moonlight. She had fooled old Granny Fox again and again. She felt very smart and very happy.</p>

<p>But with all her smartness, Dani forgot one thing. She forgot to watch the sky. She knew Roughleg the Hawk was asleep. But she never thought of Hooty the Owl.</p>

<p>Forgetting is a dreadful habit. Over in the Green Forest, Hooty had had poor hunting. He was hungry and cross. Suddenly he thought of Dani.</p>

<p class="q">"She might be out for a frolic in the moonlight," he said. "I'll go see."</p>

<p>Hooty can fly without making a sound. He floated out over the meadows like a shadow. Soon he saw Dani skipping about. His great eyes grew fierce. He floated through the moonlight until he was just above her.</p>

<p>Too late Dani looked up. Her song ended in a squeak of fear. Hooty reached down with his cruel claws—and Dani Meadow Mouse was caught at last!</p>


<h2 id="ch10"><a href="#ch10"><span>X</span> A Strange Ride and How It Ended</a></h2>

<aside class="illo">
  <figure>

    <figcaption>Dani Meadow Mouse was caught at last!</figcaption>
  </figure>
</aside>

<p>Dani had often watched Skimmer the Swallow sailing in the sky and wondered how it would feel to fly. Now here she was, up in the air! But it was terrible. She was being carried in Hooty's cruel claws. And all because she had forgotten to watch the sky.</p>

<p>Hooty's claws hurt dreadfully. But worse was knowing what would happen when they reached his home. She would be gobbled up, bones and all. As he flew, Hooty kept chuckling about his coming meal.</p>

<p>Dani looked down at the snow-covered meadows. They seemed very far below. Ahead was the Old Briar-patch where Peter Rabbit lived. Everything looked beautiful—the moonlight, the snow, the brambles. The only change was in Dani herself.</p>

<p>Suddenly she began to wriggle and struggle.</p>

<p class="q">"Keep still!" snapped Hooty.</p>

<p>But Dani struggled harder. She felt Hooty's claws slip! The truth was, he had only grabbed her coat. She kicked and twisted. Her coat tore, but she kept on. Hooty started down to get a better hold. Dani gave one more kick—and she was falling!</p>

<p>Down, down, down she fell. She hit something scratchy, then—plump!—landed in soft snow right in the middle of the Old Briar-patch. The last thing she heard was Hooty's scream of rage.</p>


<h2 id="ch11"><a href="#ch11"><span>XI</span> Peter Rabbit Gets a Fright</a></h2>

<p>Peter Rabbit sat in the Old Briar-patch trying to decide where to go that night. That morning Charlotte Chickadee had told him about Farmer Brown's young peach orchard on the hill.</p>

<p class="q">"It's a fine orchard," Charlotte had said. "There's a million insect eggs on those trees. They're mighty fine eating!"</p>

<p>Peter was thinking about those peach trees now. Their bark would be delicious. It was a long way to the orchard. Peter wondered if it was safe. He had just made up his mind to try it when—<em>thump!</em>—something dropped out of the sky at his feet.</p>

<p>Peter nearly tumbled over backward. Right then came the fierce scream of Hooty the Owl. Peter's heart almost stopped. But he knew Hooty couldn't get him in the briar-patch. When he looked to see what had fallen, his eyes grew big. There at his feet lay Dani Meadow Mouse!</p>


<h2 id="ch12"><a href="#ch12"><span>XII</span> The Old Briar-patch Has a New Tenant</a></h2>

<p>Dani slowly opened her eyes. She heard a pleasant voice, not at all like Hooty's terrible voice.</p>

<p class="q">"Why, Dani Meadow Mouse, where did you drop from?"</p>

<p>It was Peter Rabbit! Dani remembered everything now—Hooty's claws, the moonlight, struggling free, falling.</p>

<p>She tried to get up. "Ouch!" she groaned and lay still again.</p>

<p class="q">"There, there," said Peter gently. "You're safe here." His eyes filled with tears. Dani was all torn and hurt.</p>

<p>While Peter dressed her wounds, Dani told him what had happened.</p>

<p class="q">"Oh, dear, how will I ever get home?" she asked. "My warm house of grass, my tunnels, my seeds in the old fence-post!"</p>

<p class="q">"You can't," said Peter. "It's too far and too dangerous. If you went at night, Hooty might catch you. In daylight, Roughleg the Hawk would see you. And the foxes might come along anytime." He paused. "Stay here! The Old Briar-patch is the safest place in the world. You can come out in daylight and laugh at your enemies. The brambles will keep them out. There are plenty of seeds here. I'm lonesome sometimes. Stay, and we'll have the Old Briar-patch to ourselves."</p>

<p>Dani looked at Peter gratefully. "I will. Thank you, Peter Rabbit."</p>

<p>And that is how the Old Briar-patch got a new tenant.</p>

<aside class="illo">

    <figcaption>Peter Rabbit hurried along through the moonlight.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</aside>

<p class="q">"Don't go, Peter Rabbit! Don't go!" begged Dani Meadow Mouse.</p>

<p>Peter hopped to the edge of the Old Briar-patch and looked at the hill behind Farmer Brown's house. On that hill was the young peach orchard Charlotte Chickadee had told him about. Peter's mouth watered thinking of those young peach trees and their tender bark.</p>

<p class="q">"I think I will, Dani, just this once," said Peter. And off he went, lipperty-lipperty-lip, across the meadows.</p>

<p>Dani shook her head. "Foolish, foolish!" she said. "Why can't Peter be content with the good things he has?"</p>

<p>Peter hurried through the moonlight, stopping now and then to look and listen. He heard Hooty the Owl far off in the Green Forest. He knew Granny and Reddy Fox had been staying away from Farmer Brown's. So he felt safe.</p>

<p>At last Peter came to the orchard. He hopped up to the nearest peach tree and nibbled the bark. My, how good it tasted! He went all around the tree, stripping off the bark. He stood on his hind legs and reached as high as he could. Then he dug the snow away and ate down as far as he could. When he could get no more, he went on to the next tree.</p>

<p>Now Peter didn't know it, but he was doing the worst kind of mischief. When he took off the bark all the way around the trunk, he killed the tree. You see, the sap that gives life to a tree goes up just inside the bark. No bark, no sap, no tree.</p>

<p>Peter was enjoying himself so much that he forgot to watch for danger. Suddenly a great roar behind him made him jump. He knew that voice. Without looking back, he ran for the stone wall. Right at his heels, her great mouth open, was Bella the Hound.</p>


<h2 id="ch14"><a href="#ch14"><span>XIV</span> Farmer Brown Sets a Trap</a></h2>

<p>Peter Rabbit was in trouble. He was far from home, hiding in a stone wall, with Bella the Hound waiting outside. Bella hung around nearly all night. Peter didn't dare try to go home. When daylight came, it still wasn't safe.</p>

<p>Peter watched Farmer Brown and his girl come out to the orchard. They saw the mischief Peter had done, and he could tell by their voices that they were very angry. They worked all day putting something around each tree.</p>

<p>At last they went back to the house. Farmer Brown was smiling now. "I guess that will fix him!" he said.</p>

<p>Peter waited until moonlight made shadows of the trees. He had made up his mind to go straight home. But his dreadful curiosity insisted he must first see what Farmer Brown had done.</p>

<p>He hurried to the nearest tree. All around the trunk was wire netting. Peter couldn't get a nibble of bark. He hadn't meant to take any, but now that he couldn't, he wanted some. He tried the next tree. Wire. And the next. Wire.</p>

<p>Peter ran from tree to tree. At last, at the end of the orchard, he found one with no wire around it. "They must have forgotten this one!" he thought. All around on the snow were little shiny wires, but Peter didn't notice them. He hopped right in and reached up to take a bite. Just then something tugged at his hind leg.</p>


<h2 id="ch15"><a href="#ch15"><span>XV</span> Peter Rabbit Is Caught in a Snare</a></h2>

<p>When Peter felt that tug on his leg, he jumped to get away. Instead he fell flat on his face. The thing had tightened and held him fast. Peter kicked and struggled, but the more he kicked, the tighter it grew. Finally he lay still, too tired to move.</p>

<p>When he was calmer, Peter looked at what held him. It was wire—a snare Farmer Brown had set to catch him. Peter tried to bite through it, but even his sharp teeth couldn't cut it.</p>

<p>Big tears rolled down Peter's cheeks. What could he do? Then he noticed the stake the wire was tied to. The stake was wood. Peter's teeth could cut wood!</p>

<p>He dug away the snow and began to gnaw. He had the stake more than half cut through when he heard a sniff. He looked up to see Bella the Hound! She hadn't seen him yet, but she had found his tracks.</p>

<p>Peter jumped in fright and fell flat again. He scrambled up and jumped again. Just then Bella saw him and let out a roar. Peter made one more wild jump. <em>Snap!</em> The stake broke! Peter tumbled forward but scrambled to his feet. He was free—but dragging a piece of stake behind him.</p>

<p>How Peter did run! It was hard with that stake catching on things. But he made it to the old stone wall just in time, while Bella barked her disappointment.</p>


<h2 id="ch16"><a href="#ch16"><span>XVI</span> Peter Rabbit's Hard Journey</a></h2>

<p>Peter sat in the stone wall waiting for Mrs. Moon to put out her light. The wire around his leg hurt dreadfully. The piece of stake he had to drag made travel slow. He needed darkness to get home safely.</p>

<p>At last Mrs. Moon's light went out. Peter crept from his hiding place. Right away the stake caught among the stones. My, how his leg hurt when he pulled it free!</p>

<p>Very slowly he crept along close to the fences where bushes grew. He didn't dare cross open fields. The stake was forever catching in bushes with a yank at his sore leg. He had to stop often to rest. All the time he was filled with fear that Hooty or the foxes might come along.</p>

<p class="q">"Oh, dear, why did I go to that orchard when I knew I had no business there?" he said over and over.</p>

<p>Just as Mr. Sun began to light up the meadows, Peter reached the dear Old Briar-patch. Dani was watching for him. Peter started along one of her little paths, but the stake caught in the brambles. He fell down in the snow, too tired and worn out to move.</p>

<aside class="illo">

</aside>

<p>Dani limped around the Old Briar-patch, picking up seeds. She still limped from Hooty's claws, but she didn't think about that. She was too thankful to be alive. She had grown very fond of Peter Rabbit, who had been so good to her.</p>

<p>But now Dani was worried—not about herself, but about Peter. He had been gone a whole night and a whole day. He was often gone all night, but never all day too. Dani was sure something had happened.</p>

<p>She thought of how she had begged Peter not to go to the peach orchard. She had felt in her bones it wasn't safe. Why hadn't he listened?</p>

<p>It was now the second night. Dani couldn't sleep. She sat at the edge of the briar-patch to wait and watch. At last, just as Mr. Sun sent his first rays across the meadows, she saw something crawling towards her. She rubbed her eyes. It was Peter Rabbit! But he wasn't hopping. He was crawling, dragging something behind him.</p>

<p>When Peter reached the briar-patch, the thing caught in the brambles. He fell in the snow, too tired to move. Then Dani saw what the trouble was. A wire was fast to Peter's leg, and a piece of stake was tied to the wire. Peter had been caught in a snare!</p>

<p class="q">"Poor Peter Rabbit!" whispered Dani, with tears in her eyes.</p>


<h2 id="ch18"><a href="#ch18"><span>XVIII</span> Dani Meadow Mouse Returns a Kindness</a></h2>

<p>There Peter lay, too tired to move, crying because he had made it home but was stopped on his own doorstep. The stake was caught in the brambles. Suppose Granny Fox came along now!</p>

<p>By and by Peter noticed someone wiping away his tears. It was Dani, singing in a funny little voice:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Isn't any use to cry!<br>
  Not a bit! Not a bit!<br>
  Wipe your eyes and wipe 'em dry!<br>
  Use your wit! Use your wit!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Peter smiled in spite of himself.</p>

<p class="q">"That's right!" said Dani. "Now lie still while I see what can be done."</p>

<p>She scurried off to look at the stake. It was still partly attached to a bigger piece. Dani began to gnaw. Mr. Sun climbed higher. Dani grew hungry, but she kept gnawing.</p>

<p>Then she saw Farmer Brown's girl coming straight toward the briar-patch! Dani didn't say a word to Peter. She just gnawed faster than ever.</p>

<p>Farmer Brown's girl was almost there when Dani finished. She hurried to tell Peter there was nothing stopping him now. While Peter slowly dragged himself along, Dani trotted behind to keep the wire from catching.</p>

<p>They reached Peter's secret hiding place just as Farmer Brown's girl came up to the edge of the briar-patch.</p>

<p class="q">"So this is where that rabbit lives!" said she. "We'll set some snares here too."</p>

<p>And for the rest of the afternoon, she set snares all around the Old Briar-patch.</p>


<h2 id="ch19"><a href="#ch19"><span>XIX</span> Peter Rabbit and Dani Meadow Mouse Live High</a></h2>

<p>Peter sat in his secret place with his leg all swelled up and sore from the wire. He could hear Farmer Brown's girl setting snares all around the briar-patch. In spite of his pain, Peter was curious.</p>

<p class="q">"Go see what she's doing," he said to Dani. "You're small enough to stay hidden."</p>

<p>Dani crept out and watched. She came back and reported. "She's putting little loops of wire in all your paths. And she's put cabbage leaves and apples all around."</p>

<p class="q">"We must be careful!" said Peter.</p>

<p>Peter's leg was in a bad way. The wire was cutting into it. Dani tried to gnaw through it, but that was no use. Then she tried working it loose. It slipped a little! She kept at it. By and by she had it so loose she slipped it right off Peter's leg.</p>

<p>My, how thankful Peter was! But Dani said it was nothing at all. She owed Peter more than that for being so good to her.</p>

<p>It was a long time before Peter could hop well again. But after the first day he could get around. He found snares in every one of his paths. But he knew what they were now. He showed Dani how she, because she was so small, could safely run among the snares and steal the cabbage and apples.</p>

<p>Dani thought this great fun. So every day she stole the bait, and she and Peter lived well while Peter's leg healed. All the time Farmer Brown's girl wondered why she couldn't catch Peter Rabbit.</p>


<h2 id="ch20"><a href="#ch20"><span>XX</span> Timid Dani Meadow Mouse</a></h2>

<p>Everybody says Dani Meadow Mouse is timid. And she is! But she isn't ashamed of it.</p>

<p class="q">"If I weren't afraid, I wouldn't always be watching out," said Dani to Old Mrs. Toad one morning. "And if I weren't watching out, I wouldn't have any more chance than that ant." She pointed at an ant on the ground.</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Toad's tongue darted out and back. The ant was gone.</p>

<p class="q">"No chance at all," Dani continued. "Now if I were big and strong, or had swift wings, or were so homely no one wanted me, like—like some folks I know, I wouldn't need to be afraid."</p>

<p>Mrs. Toad looked up sharply, but Dani was gazing across the meadows looking very innocent.</p>

<p class="q">"Well," said Mrs. Toad, "fear seems foolish to me. I mind my own business, and no one bothers me."</p>

<p class="q">"I wish it were that easy for me," said Dani. "There's Mrs. Blacksnake and Granny Fox and Reddy Fox and Redtail the Hawk and Hooty the Owl, all watching for a chance to eat me."</p>

<p class="q">"That does sound dreadful," admitted Mrs. Toad.</p>

<p class="q">"It's not so bad," said Dani. "It's rather exciting. It keeps my wits sharp. By the way, see how that grass is moving over there. It looks like Mrs. Blacksnake—"</p>

<p class="q">"I just remembered something I have to do at the Smiling Pool!" shouted Mrs. Toad, hurrying off so fast she tripped over her own feet.</p>

<p>Dani chuckled. "Oh, no, Mrs. Toad doesn't know what fear is!"</p>


<h2 id="ch21"><a href="#ch21"><span>XXI</span> An Exciting Day for Dani Meadow Mouse</a></h2>

<p>One morning Dani set out along one of her paths to get some special grass seeds. The seeds grew a long way off, and to reach them she had to cross an open place where the grass was too short to hide under.</p>

<p class="q">"I feel in my bones this will be an exciting day," said Dani.</p>

<p>She had gone only a little way when she heard a quiet rustling behind her. She didn't need to look. It was Mrs. Blacksnake!</p>

<p>Dani could run fast, but she knew Mrs. Blacksnake could run faster. "If my legs can't save me, my wits must," she thought. "I must reach the old hollow fence-post!"</p>

<p>She was almost out of breath when she reached the post and ducked inside. She heard Mrs. Blacksnake right behind her. Now the post was hollow its whole length, but halfway was an old knot-hole just big enough for Dani to squeeze through. Mrs. Blacksnake didn't know about that hole. It was dark inside, so she didn't see Dani pop through it.</p>

<p>Dani ran back along the top of the log just in time to see Mrs. Blacksnake's tail disappear inside. Then what do you think Dani did? She followed Mrs. Blacksnake right into the post! But she didn't make a sound.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blacksnake kept going out the other end, sure Dani had gone that way. As soon as she was out, Dani ran back to where another path branched off.</p>

<p class="q">"Mrs. Blacksnake will think I took this path," thought Dani. "So I won't."</p>

<p>She ran on until she came to two more paths. She took the left one and scampered on, sure that Mrs. Blacksnake was now badly fooled.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Brains are better far than speed,<br>
  As wise men long ago agreed,"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>said Dani. "I wonder what happens next."</p>


<h2 id="ch22"><a href="#ch22"><span>XXII</span> What Happened Next to Dani Meadow Mouse</a></h2>

<p>Dani didn't waste time thinking about her escape from Mrs. Blacksnake. She knew that if she thought too much about what had happened, she couldn't watch for what might happen.</p>

<p>She reached the edge of the open place where the grass was too short to hide under. She peeped out this way and that way, not forgetting to look at the sky. She saw no one. She ran across as fast as she could.</p>

<p>But all the time, Redtail the Hawk was sitting in a tree far away. Her eyes are very keen. She saw Dani the instant she started across. With a chuckle, she spread her wings.</p>

<p>About halfway across, Dani looked behind her. Her heart jumped into her mouth. There was Redtail with her claws ready to grab her!</p>

<p>Dani squeaked with fright. But she didn't give up. Three jumps ahead was a strange thing on the ground. She didn't know what it was, but maybe there was a hole in it.</p>

<p>One jump! Two jumps! There <em>was</em> a hole! Three jumps! Dani dived in just in time. It was an old tomato can Farmer Brown's girl had dropped there.</p>

<p>Redtail screamed with rage. She struck the can with her claws again and again, but it just rolled away. Finally she flew off in disgust.</p>

<p>Dani wisely decided to stay hidden for a while. And it was very lucky she did.</p>


<h2 id="ch23"><a href="#ch23"><span>XXIII</span> Reddy Fox Grows Curious</a></h2>

<p>Dani sat inside the old tomato can for a long time. She didn't dare peek out. She decided to take a nap. But she had no sooner closed her eyes than she heard soft footsteps. Her eyes flew open. She knew those footsteps. They belonged to Reddy Fox!</p>

<p>Soon a whiff of scent blew into the can. It <em>was</em> Reddy!</p>

<p class="q">"I hope he doesn't find me," thought Dani.</p>

<p>It was curiosity that had brought Reddy. He had seen Redtail strike at something and miss. "I wonder what that was about," Reddy had thought. "I believe I'll go see."</p>

<p>Now Reddy ran back and forth with his nose to the ground. Suddenly he stopped. "Ha!" He had found where Dani had run across the open place. His nose led him right to the old can. He hopped over it, but on the other side there was no scent. In a flash he understood. Dani was hiding inside!</p>

<p class="q">"I've got you this time!" he snarled, sniffing at the opening.</p>


<h2 id="ch24"><a href="#ch24"><span>XXIV</span> Reddy Fox Loses His Temper</a></h2>

<p>Reddy had found Dani, and he was in no hurry. He lay down to peep into the can.</p>

<p class="q">"I've got you this time, Miss Smarty," he taunted. "What are you going to do about it?"</p>

<p>Dani didn't answer. She was too frightened. But she was thinking hard. She had been in tight places before. Something might happen. Anyway, Reddy still had to get her out of this can.</p>

<p>Reddy spent a long time saying scary things. At last he decided to end it. He thrust his nose into the opening, but it was too small. He only scratched it on the sharp edges.</p>

<p class="q">"I'll pull you out," said Reddy, thrusting in a paw.</p>

<p>Dani bit it hard! Reddy yelped and pulled it out. He tried the other paw. Dani bit that one even harder! Reddy danced with pain and anger. Then he lost his temper.</p>

<p>He hit the can, and away it rolled with Dani inside. He hit it again and again, batting it this way and that. He was so angry he didn't notice where he was knocking it.</p>

<p>Finally he sent it spinning into the long grass on the far side of the open place—right near one of Dani's private paths. Like a flash, Dani was out and running. She dodged into one path, then another, and reached a tangle of barbed wire where she was safe.</p>

<p class="q">"Whew!" said Dani. "That was the closest yet! But I guess I'll get that special grass seed after all."</p>

<p>And she did. While to this day, Reddy Fox wonders how Dani got out of that can without his knowing it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And so you see what temper does<br>
  For those who give it rein;<br>
  It cheats them of the very thing<br>
  They seek so hard to gain.</p>
