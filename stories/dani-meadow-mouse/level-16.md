  <p>Dani Meadow Mouse sat on her doorstep. She looked sad. She did not want to play.</p>

  <p>What was wrong? Dani was upset about her tail. Her tail was very short.</p>

  <p>She had met her cousin Whitefoot. He had a long, pretty tail. Now Dani wished she had a long tail too.</p>

  <p>She was so busy wishing that she forgot to watch for danger. A hawk almost got her! It was a close call.</p>


  <h2 id="ch2"><a href="#ch2"><span>II</span> Dani Meadow Mouse and Her Short Tail</a></h2>

  <p>Old Mrs. Toad came to see Dani. "What is wrong?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I want a long tail," said Dani.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Toad laughed. "A long tail would be silly on you! You would trip on it. Be happy with what you have."</p>

  <p>"I will try," said Dani.</p>


  <h2 id="ch3"><a href="#ch3"><span>III</span> Dani Meadow Mouse Plays Hide and Seek</a></h2>

  <p>Dani Meadow Mouse has many enemies. Foxes want to eat her. Hawks want to eat her. She must always watch out.</p>

  <p>When snow came, Dani was happy. She made tunnels under the snow. She made little doors to peek out.</p>

  <p>One day Reddy Fox saw Dani peek out. Reddy ran to catch her. But Dani was gone! She ran through her tunnel.</p>

  <p>Dani popped up at a new door. She laughed at Reddy. Reddy dug and dug but could not catch her.</p>

  <p>Reddy Fox told Granny Fox about Dani. "She is fat," said Reddy. "But I cannot catch her."</p>

  <p>"I will help you," said Granny.</p>

  <p>The next day, both foxes went to the meadow. Granny was very smart. She listened for Dani in the tunnels. Then she jumped down into the snow!</p>

  <p>She almost got Dani! But Dani ran fast. The foxes kept jumping into the snow. Dani kept running.</p>


  <h2 id="ch5"><a href="#ch5"><span>V</span> What Happened on the Green Meadows</a></h2>

  <p>Poor Dani! Two foxes were after her now. She ran and ran in her tunnels.</p>

  <p>Granny Fox could hear her. She jumped into the snow again and again. One time her claws scratched Dani!</p>

  <p>Dani was so scared. She sat very still. When she was still, she made no sound. The foxes could not find her.</p>


  <h2 id="ch6"><a href="#ch6"><span>VI</span> Dani Meadow Mouse Remembers and Reddy Fox Forgets</a></h2>

  <p>Dani had to run again. "I must find a safe place!" she thought.</p>

  <p>Then she remembered! There was an old fence-post with a hollow inside. Sharp wires were near it. She had seeds hidden there.</p>

  <p>She ran to the fence-post. Granny Fox stopped before the wires. She knew they were sharp.</p>

  <p>But Reddy forgot about the wires. He jumped in. "OW!" He hurt his paw on a sharp wire.</p>

  <p>"That is what you get for forgetting," said Granny.</p>

  <p>And Dani was safe in the hollow post.</p>

      <figcaption>Safe in the hollow of the old fence-post.</figcaption>

  </aside>

  <p>Granny Fox had a new plan. She would wait. She knew Dani would come out soon.</p>

  <p>For many days, Dani stayed inside. Then she got tired of hiding. She began to go out a little bit each day.</p>

  <p>It was going to snow again. Granny smiled. "Tomorrow I will get her," she said.</p>

  <p>Early the next morning, Granny lay down near Dani's home. Reddy covered her with snow. Then Reddy went away to hide.</p>


  <h2 id="ch8"><a href="#ch8"><span>VIII</span> Brother North Wind Proves a Friend</a></h2>

  <p>Dani had not seen the foxes for days. She was careful, but she was not so scared now.</p>

  <p>One morning, new snow covered all her doors. She dug a new hole to peek out.</p>

  <p>She saw a little pile of snow nearby. "That is funny," she thought. "What is under that pile?"</p>

  <p>Just then the wind blew some snow off the pile. Dani saw something red. It was Granny Fox's fur!</p>

  <p>"Granny Fox, you cannot fool me!" shouted Dani. She ducked back down.</p>

  <p>Granny was so mad! She had to go home with no breakfast.</p>

<h2 id="ch9"><a href="#ch9"><span>IX</span> Dani Meadow Mouse Is Caught at Last</a></h2>

<p>Dani was very happy. She had fooled Granny Fox again and again!</p>

<p>She sang and skipped in the moonlight. But she forgot one thing. She forgot to look up at the sky.</p>

<p>Hooty the Owl was out hunting. He saw Dani dancing in the snow. He flew down without a sound.</p>

<p>Too late, Dani looked up. Hooty grabbed her with his claws. Dani was caught!</p>

<p>Hooty flew over the meadow with Dani. His claws hurt her. Dani was very scared.</p>

<p>But Dani did not give up. She wiggled and kicked. She felt Hooty's claws slip a little.</p>

<p>She kicked harder. Her coat ripped, but she was free! She fell down, down, down.</p>

<p>She landed in soft snow. She was in the Old Briar-patch! Hooty screamed with anger. But he could not get her there.</p>


<h2 id="ch11"><a href="#ch11"><span>XI</span> Peter Rabbit Gets a Fright</a></h2>

<p>Peter Rabbit lived in the Old Briar-patch. He was sitting there when something fell from the sky. Thump!</p>

<p>Peter jumped. Then Hooty screamed. Peter was scared at first.</p>

<p>He looked to see what had fallen. It was Dani Meadow Mouse! She was hurt but alive.</p>


<h2 id="ch12"><a href="#ch12"><span>XII</span> The Old Briar-patch Has a New Tenant</a></h2>

<p>Dani opened her eyes. "Where am I?" she asked.</p>

<p>"You are in my home," said Peter Rabbit. "You are safe here."</p>

<p>Peter helped fix her cuts. Dani told him what had happened.</p>

<p>"How will I get back home?" she asked. "It is too far. The foxes will get me."</p>

<p>"Stay here with me," said Peter. "The brambles will keep us safe. There are seeds to eat."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Peter," said Dani. And she stayed.</p>

</aside>

<p>"Don't go, Peter!" said Dani. But Peter wanted to see the peach orchard on the hill.</p>

<p>He hopped through the moonlight. At last he got to the orchard. He nibbled the bark of a young tree. It was so good!</p>

<p>He ate bark from tree after tree. He did not know he was hurting the trees. He did not watch for danger.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard a roar. It was Bella the Hound! Peter ran for the stone wall. He just made it.</p>


<h2 id="ch14"><a href="#ch14"><span>XIV</span> Farmer Brown Sets a Trap</a></h2>

<p>Peter hid in the stone wall. Bella waited outside all night. Peter could not go home.</p>

<p>The next day, Farmer Brown saw what Peter had done. He was angry. He put wire around all the trees.</p>

<p>That night, Peter tried to go home. But first he had to look at those trees. Most had wire around them. He found one with no wire.</p>

<p>He hopped over to eat some bark. Then something grabbed his leg. It was a trap!</p>


<h2 id="ch15"><a href="#ch15"><span>XV</span> Peter Rabbit Is Caught in a Snare</a></h2>

<p>Peter kicked and pulled. The wire got tighter. He could not get free. He began to cry.</p>

<p>Then he saw the stake. The wire was tied to a wooden stake. He could chew wood!</p>

<p>He chewed and chewed. He was almost done when Bella came back. She saw him!</p>

<p>Peter jumped. Snap! The stake broke. He was free! He ran and ran. He made it to the stone wall just in time.</p>


<h2 id="ch16"><a href="#ch16"><span>XVI</span> Peter Rabbit's Hard Journey</a></h2>

<p>Peter waited in the wall. His leg hurt. The wire was still on it. A piece of the stake was tied to the wire.</p>

<p>When it got very dark, Peter began to go home. It was slow and hard. The stake kept catching on things.</p>

<p>He was so tired. He was so scared. At last he saw the Old Briar-patch. Dani was waiting for him.</p>

<p>Peter crawled to the brambles. The stake got stuck. He fell down in the snow. He could not move.</p>

<aside class="illo">

  </figure>
</aside>

<p>Dani had been so worried. Peter had been gone for two days. She was sure something bad had happened.</p>

<p>When she saw him crawling home, she ran to help. He had a wire on his leg. A stake was tied to the wire.</p>

<p>"Poor Peter!" said Dani.</p>


<h2 id="ch18"><a href="#ch18"><span>XVIII</span> Dani Meadow Mouse Returns a Kindness</a></h2>

<p>Peter lay in the snow, crying. Dani sang a little song to cheer him up.</p>

<p>"Don't cry," she said. "I will help you."</p>

<p>She ran to look at the stake. She began to chew. She chewed and chewed.</p>

<p>Then she saw Farmer Brown's girl coming! She chewed faster.</p>

<p>Just in time, she got the stake free. She helped Peter get to his hiding spot. They were safe.</p>

<p>Farmer Brown's girl set more traps around the briar-patch.</p>


<h2 id="ch19"><a href="#ch19"><span>XIX</span> Peter Rabbit and Dani Meadow Mouse Live High</a></h2>

<p>The wire was still on Peter's leg. Dani worked on it. At last she got it off.</p>

<p>Peter's leg was very sore. He could not hop well. But Dani had an idea.</p>

<p>She was small. She could go between the traps. She stole the bait that Farmer Brown's girl had left. Apples and cabbage!</p>

<p>Dani and Peter ate very well. Farmer Brown's girl never did catch Peter.</p>


<h2 id="ch20"><a href="#ch20"><span>XX</span> Timid Dani Meadow Mouse</a></h2>

<p>Everyone says Dani is timid. She is! But she is not ashamed.</p>

<p>"If I were not afraid, I would not watch out," she told Mrs. Toad. "Then someone would eat me."</p>

<p>"I am never afraid," said Mrs. Toad.</p>

<p>"Is that so?" said Dani. "Look, the grass is moving. It looks like a snake—"</p>

<p>Mrs. Toad ran away as fast as she could!</p>

<p>Dani laughed. "She is afraid too," she said.</p>


<h2 id="ch21"><a href="#ch21"><span>XXI</span> An Exciting Day for Dani Meadow Mouse</a></h2>

<p>One day Dani went to get some seeds. She heard something behind her. It was a snake!</p>

<p>Dani ran to a hollow log. She went in one end. The snake followed.</p>

<p>But there was a hole in the middle of the log. Dani slipped through it. The snake did not see.</p>

<p>Dani ran back and went in the log again. She was behind the snake now! The snake went out the other end, looking for her.</p>

<p>Dani ran home a different way. She had fooled the snake!</p>


<h2 id="ch22"><a href="#ch22"><span>XXII</span> What Happened Next to Dani Meadow Mouse</a></h2>

<p>Dani still wanted those seeds. She came to a place with short grass. She had to run across it.</p>

<p>She looked around. No one was there. She ran.</p>

<p>But a hawk was watching from far away! The hawk flew at Dani.</p>

<p>Dani looked back and saw her coming. She squeaked with fear. Just ahead was a strange thing—an old can.</p>

<p>Dani jumped into the can. The hawk could not get her! The hawk flew away, angry.</p>


<h2 id="ch23"><a href="#ch23"><span>XXIII</span> Reddy Fox Grows Curious</a></h2>

<p>Dani stayed in the can. She was going to take a nap. Then she heard footsteps. It was Reddy Fox!</p>

<p>Reddy sniffed around. He found where Dani had run. His nose led him to the can.</p>

<p>"I know you are in there!" said Reddy.</p>


<h2 id="ch24"><a href="#ch24"><span>XXIV</span> Reddy Fox Loses His Temper</a></h2>

<p>Reddy tried to get Dani out. He stuck his nose in the can. It was too small.</p>

<p>He put his paw in. Dani bit it! Reddy yelped. He tried the other paw. Dani bit that one too!</p>

<p>Reddy got very mad. He hit the can. It rolled away. He hit it again and again.</p>

<p>He hit it so many times that it rolled into the tall grass. It was right by one of Dani's paths!</p>

<p>Dani ran out and down her path. She was safe! Reddy never knew how Dani got away.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you lose your temper,<br>
  You lose the game.<br>
  So keep your cool,<br>
  And you'll have no shame.</p>
