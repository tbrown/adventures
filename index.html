    <h3>Charming folktales about wildlife and our environment</h3>
    <p>Set in the meadows, forest, marshes, and mountains near a small farm in the American northeast, these stories encourage readers to understand animal behaviors, appreciate natural resources, and enjoy life.</p>
    <h3>Respectful, moral lessons for strong values</h3>
    <p>Neighborliness, hard work, self esteem, curiosity, patience, caution, kindness, conflict resolution, and more. Each story instills important lessons about how to be reasonable and respectful to other people.</p>

    <h3>Free, online children’s books from a wonderful author</h3>
    <p>Based on public domain texts written more than a century ago by Thornton W. Burgess, these stories have been thoughtfully typeset with accessibility in mind. Read to your children from your phone or iPad.</p>
    <h3>Beloved bedtime stories for a new generation</h3>
    <p>Handed down as physical books for generations, now updated for gender balance and to avoid stereotypes. Only five of the 64+ original characters were female, and the dialect writing was quite distracting.</p>
